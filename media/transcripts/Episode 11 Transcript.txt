Loading: “The white porcelain cup looks very similar to my skull. When I hold the cup tightly, a strange arm suddenly sprouts from my arm like a tree, and the hand dangling on this new arm quickly picks up the porcelain cup and throws it down over my shoulder. But my arm is guarding the porcelain cup, which means that the shattered thing is in fact, my skull. The arm moves just as the tree arm slithers back into it. The white paper that was holding back the flood will be torn asunder, but my arm is still guarding the porcelain cup.” Welcome everyone to the “Don't Listen to This” podcast.
Babaloga: Ayoo. Uh. All right. You know what time of year it is. I'm sure you're all very excited for us to give out some awards, but -
Loading: Oh, first off, we have some housekeeping.
Babaloga: Yeah.
Loading: Um.
Babaloga: So, yeah, we notice, uh, something weird in our episode count. Apparently, we skipped episode eleven. That's… embarrassing. Obviously. So we're gonna have to fix this. 
Loading: Yeah. 
Babaloga: Uh, so. So. yeah, we we're going back. We're doing episode eleven just for the sake of keeping it consistent count. And then we're going to be proceeding as normal from there.
Loading: Yep.
Babaloga: All right. So it's game awards season. Are you ready to hand out some awards for the most impactful titles of the Year of our Lord two thousand and twenty?
Loading: Well now. Okay. Earlier today I said to Baba, “Hey, are you good to record?” Baba said “sure”. And Baba said, “Do you have any ideas?” And we went back and forth and Baba said: “We're doing our game of the year episode.” And I'm like, okay, good. I'm gonna -  I'm gonna, like, look through what games I've played this year and stuff like that. Like, are we doing games that we played this year? Are we doing games that came out this year? Right? Which is a big difference. And it's important difference. Um, Baba, what did you tell me? When I jumped on the call?
Babaloga: I told you what I think - I thought was obvious from my original message, which was, we're not doing the games of 2025. 2025 isn't even over yet. And frankly, I think it's the height of hubris to think we know what the most important game of any year is going to be, when that year only just ended. I think five years is a pretty good amount of time to be able to look back and say, yeah, okay, that was the best game of that year. That was the most impactful game of that year.
Loading: So that said, I did want to highlight some games I played this year.
Babaloga: Do you want to do that first or should we - do we - 
Loading: I'm going to do that first -
Babaloga: - do we want to do that award stuff - 
Loading: - and you can't stop me.
Babaloga: Yeah. Go ahead.
Loading: Uh, first off, 2022’s Chained Echoes. It's a JRPG, old school inspired JRPG with some very nice pixel art.
Babaloga: [Distant] Hell yeah, it is.
Loading: Hell yeah it is. Uh, I played Final Fantasy 5, the pixel remake, finally. That game fucking kicks ass. Badlands. Badlands crew is a weird one. You like, build your mad Max Road Warrior vehicle, and then you drive around desert. It's a pretty neat game. 
Let's see. Marvel’s Midnight Sun’s a game that I finally played this year. Much better than I expected it to be. I was looking for - I got it, like, on pretty deep discount. Uh, and I was just sort of looking for, like an RPG to fill up my time with. I ended up really enjoying my time with that game. 
A little tiny game called Star Valor, which is like a top down sort of… spaceship game, which is really fun and cool. And it's - it's sort of one of those games that's chugging along, and it serves a very niche audience. And I really like those games. I like highlighting them. 
Anode Heart - Layer Null. I am constantly on the search for a non-roguelike deck builder and Anode Heart - Layer Null is a very good non-roguelike deck builder. It's very - it sort of hearkens a lot back to the Pokemon TCG games, for the old Game Boy, where you're sort of going through different areas, going up against different decks that are different types of things. It's a very good game. 
Oh, Monster Train 2 came out this year. That game is fucking incredible. That is easily top three if not top one deck building roguelikes for me, and I'm a connoisseur of deck building roguelikes. Megabank came out this year. That game is just good. It's like Vampire Survivors in a 3D environment, which is really cool. It doesn't sound like a lot, but it's really quite good. 
FBC Firebreak I wanted to highlight this game because I found it deeply disappointing Baba and Hass made me play it, and I wish there was more to it than there is, but unfortunately it's exactly what it is.
Babaloga: So though how sick does that Control 2 trailer look, huh? You see how fucked up those pigeons were?
Loading: Do you see how fucked up those pigeons were? It looks pretty good. Maybe I'll play Control.
Babaloga: Wait. Have you not played - you haven't played Control?
Loading: No.
Babaloga: That's crazy.
Loading: Absolum is a side scrolling beat-em-up with a very nice art style. It's really good. It's a genre that you don't really see a lot these days, and it's - it's sort of excellent in that way. Y.O.M.I. HUSTLE! It's Y.O.M.I. fuckin’ HUSTLE. Your Only Move Is HUSTLE is a turn based fighting game. It's incredible. And you should play it. It's like five bucks.
Babaloga: Yeah, and the title's a fucking lie because you have, like, a million moves in that game.
Loading: You do! Mykopunk. Mykopunk is like Deep Rock Galactic. But the terrain isn't destructible and it's all combat and it fucking kicks ass. Currently, there's only two thousand reviews on Steam, which is a shame, because everyone should be - should have been playing Mycopunk this year.
Babaloga: I do actually want to play Mycopunk. I've had that one on my radar for a while.
Loading: Mycopunk is really cool.
Babaloga: [Muffled] All the other things you've been saying are sort of outside my genre wheelhouse. But - but Mycopunk, it's like, yeah, I have. I actually wanted to play that one.
Loading: Uh, Limbus Company. I spent the last three of my months being consumed by Limbus Company.
Babaloga: Sorry. When you say it like that, it sounds like you spent the last three months that you had to live. 
Loading: Yes
Babaloga: “I spent the last three of my months.”
Loading: I've caught up, and I'm dead now. I'm dying because of Limbus - because of Dante, from Limbus Company.
Babaloga: My last three remaining months spent on this earth - 
Loading: My last three. I do not like gacha games. I find them predatory. I fucking love Limbus Company. That is a testament to how good the writing of this game is.
Babaloga: Or it's a testament to the fact that you've been predated upon.
Loading: I actually haven't - I've only spent like twenty bucks on the game and that was for a season pass after I finished the rest of the content. Q-UP! Q-UP - you flip coins, you do math. It's an engine building game. You build an engine that happens when you flip coins. It's really cool and really interesting.
Babaloga: That one ate Hass as well.
Loading: It's consumed Hass. Hass has been eaten by it. Uh, Echo Point Nova. Echo Point Nova is like, cracked. Echo Point Nova feels like entering a fugue state where you ride around on a hoverboard and shoot mans in the head. Echo Point Nova's like, truly one of the best listening to a podcast games have had all year. It's non-stop action. It's just the shooting. There's no story. You just ride around. It's great. Wheel World. Wheel World is one that I regrettably didn't spend as much time with as I would have liked. You build a bike and you race it. It's a really cool game. Uh, and I need to spend more time with it. That has been my 2025 video game recap. How long did that take? Like eight minutes.
Babaloga: Hang on, let me check. We have been recording for almost nine minutes now. Yeah. Yeah, it was pretty close.
Loading: Do you have any games you want to spotlight from this year?
Babaloga: Um, yeah, maybe, but I  - I don't have to jump straight into it. How have you been? It's been a while since we talked.
Loading: You rat bastard.
Babaloga: Um, I, I literally started out asking like, hey, do you want to do that first or - And you interrupted, like, I'm going to do that first and you can't stop me. Yeah.
Loading: You know what? You're right, you're right. Fair dinkum. How - I - I've been doing pretty good. How about you? How's classes been?
Babaloga: Uh, classes went pretty well. Yeah. We did - we had a multiplayer game which previous years did not do.
Loading: Oh. What - what game?
Babaloga: Well, we made it. It's called Beat Squash. It's on my itch.
Loading: Is that why you brought up Guys™ recently?
Babaloga: No, not online… Well, actually, kind of. Yes, because the fact that it was multiplayer got people talking about multiplayer and then like online multiplayer, and I was like, oh, that's a whole can of worms. And so I mentioned Guys™ and then that got me thinking about Guys™, and then I put Guys™ back up. 
Loading: All right. 
Babaloga: So indirectly related. Yeah. But yeah, Beat Squash turned out pretty good. It's - it's a rhythm squash game. Squash being tennis against a wall.
Loading: Oh okay. I thought you meant like the… veg? 
Babaloga: The gourd?
Loading: Gourd. Yeah. The gourd. Is it a - is it a fruit or a vegetable?
Babaloga: It's a fruit. Yeah. It's got seeds in it. That's how you know it's a fruit.
Loading: Yeah. It's in the Constitution.
Babaloga: Yeah. That's in the Constitution. If you do, if you perform a constitution check. By which I mean checking the Constitution…
Loading: Mhm.
Babaloga: It's in there. Anyway. Um.
Loading: Anyway.
Babaloga: Yeah. You know I was in - you mentioned a lot of uh, deck builders in there, uh, in your little spiel. I was at the game store earlier buying Christmas gifts for family. -I was actually hoping to get my mom a copy of Deception Murder in Hong Kong, but nowhere that I looked had it. I went to three different game stores. Not, uh, not very stocked, unfortunately. But I did see that there is a Mistborn Deck Builder game… 
Loading: Oh?
Babaloga: Which is like, super interesting, right? Because I feel like you don't get a, you don't get games based on book series directly that often. 
Loading: No…
Babaloga: I guess like Dune Imperium when that originally came out or is that new? You know what? I'm getting confused with Twilight Imperium, which is an older game. Um, no, but there was an older Dune game, wasn't there, I think?
Loading: Yeah, like one of the old 4X games was Dune game.
Babaloga: Yeah. And that probably predates the, the, the first movie, the David Cage one or - not David Cage, David Lynch.
Loading: Remember when they let David Cage -
Babaloga: David Cage's Dune!
Loading: David Cage's Dune, oh no.
Babaloga: Honestly, David Lynch's Dune had features in it that I think would also be in David Cage's Dune. David Cage's would just also be much less interesting.
Loading: Hmm. Interesting.
Babaloga: Yeah. So this - I haven't even looked into this board game yet. I just saw that it exists and that it's like a huge box, but describes itself as a deck builder game. So yeah, kind of interesting stuff there.
Loading: Yeah.
Babaloga: Let's see, what did I end up getting? Uh, it was, um, okay. You know Mysterium.
Loading: Yeah. That's the - that's the one where it's cards and you have to like, guess based on…
Babaloga: Yeah, it's like pictures and they get you to - the person who is a ghost is trying to communicate something to you via pictures. I've only played it once, and we were sort of under the recommended player count. I don't have like the strongest grasp on the game, but they have a - like a quick and light version of the game now. It's not an expansion. It's like an alternate version of the game called Mysterium… It's like Mysterium Carnival? It's like carnival themed… Mysterium… park. Yeah, Mysterium Park, which looked interesting to me and was half the price of regular Mysterium. So I picked that up. And uh, once it has been gifted to said relative, I can play it and report back on how it is.
Loading: I desperately wish my family was interested in playing more complicated board games.
Babaloga: My family's not interested in playing complicated board games, but they are... I - I can convince my mom and and like my aunt to play different board games. Like, they're not only interested in playing the board games, they already know,
Loading: My family, like, we grew up playing a ton of Ticket to Ride, so they're like, down for Ticket to Ride.
Babaloga: Wait, how old is Ticket to Ride?
Loading: I don't know, but I tried to get them to play Betrayal on the House on the Hill once, and my dad was having none of it, because that's a game that requires - I didn't realize how much buy-in that game sort of requires from you. Like, it - it requires you to sort of be like, okay, this is camp and we're gonna be camp, you know?
Babaloga: Yeah, I have never played it, but I, I understand the vibe.
Loading: Yeah.
Babaloga: Insofar as you've described it.
Loading: I think I can get them to play Heat. Have you played Heat?
Babaloga: I haven't played Heat either. I - I'm honestly my my board game literacy is pretty poor. I've played Root and Oath, you know the big Leder games. I have not played Arcs though, so not all of the big Leder games. Um, and now I've played like a bunch of random things in games like Magical Athlete, which kicks ass absolutely up and down the court. Magical Athlete is the best board game. [Editors note, Hass agrees; this game was so fucking fun]. 
Loading: Have I forced you to play Exceed yet? 
Babaloga: Nope. 
Loading: Exceed is - Exceed is the fighting game card game. It's really good. It's so fucking good.
Babaloga: Exceed… I actually, you know, what's funny is I've playtested people's fighting game board games at Playtest Thursday as well, at school. There was one that was martial arts based that was really interesting. It was like a martial arts deck builder, like card game.
Loading: You should check out Exceed. It's, it's got some really interesting mechanical stuff going on.
Babaloga: You know what? I do - I have a lot of games in my orbit, but I'll add it. I'll write it down.
Loading: It's also like a board game that takes literally fifteen minutes to play a round of, which is really nice.
Babaloga: I think I want to start playing more board games in Tabletop Simulator, just because it's easier and cheaper than trying.
Loading: For sure. That one in particular, uh, the company who makes it notoriously don't do second print runs, uh, in every deck is specifically made for each character. So there's just some decks that you can't get your hands on.
Babaloga: Oh, okay. Okay. Can I tell you about a really interesting game that I read about at game school and have never played?
Loading: Yes.
Babaloga: It's called Ace of Aces. And the game takes the form of two books and it's - so it's a dog fighting -  it's like a World War two plane dogfighting, not actual dogs dogfighting. Yeah.
Loading: Although…
Babaloga: It's it's a, it's an airplanes dogfighting game where each player has a book. And basically each page of each book represents one of the possible configurations of these two planes.
Loading: Oh?
Babaloga: And then, like at the bottom of each page, it's like you have a standard set of actions you can take like bank left, bank right. Like slow down, speed up, whatever, etc. and then you decide which action you're taking and you just say the number that it says there out loud, and the other player decides which action they're taking and says the number that says there out loud, and you can't reverse engineer the action from the number. And then you combine those numbers. I think maybe it's there, just like you put them together to make a page number, or maybe there's some other process to it. But basically, like your combined numbers point you both to a page in your book that you flip to that, that is, that represents the new state of the two planes in space.
Loading: That's actually incredible.
Babaloga: Yeah. It's like, it's so cool. And I've been trying to find a copy of it, but they printed it - they did like the original print run in like the 80s. And then they did a special edition print run in ‘93, and I think that's it. So yeah, but it seems really interesting. Yeah. So that's games, right? It's weird. When you go to game school, you end up thinking and talking about games a whole lot more than you did before? 
Loading: Yeah. 
Babaloga: Isn't that crazy? 
Loading: Yeah. So you, listener at home, your job is to go play exceed and Ace of Aces, I guess.
Babaloga: Well, if you can find it. No, your job is to find Ace of Aces by it. And then DM me on discord saying that you have it, and I'll send you my address and you can ship it to me.
Loading: I might actually know a guy. I'll look into it. That's not a joke. I'll look into it for you.
Babaloga: Yeah. No, I believe you. Yeah, I guess we'll see how that pans out. Listeners, stay tuned to see if Loading’s guy comes through.
Loading: So currently we're looking at a Wikipedia - we're both looking at a Wikipedia list of every single game that came out in 2020.
Babaloga: Let me real quick look at games that came out this year and see if I've got anything to say about any of them. Obviously, I won't be giving any awards out to any of them. It's far too early for that, but -
Loading: Oh, I forgot to boost Aethermancer, too. That game's good.
Babaloga: Uh, hurdling. I have not played much of Herdlings. I have actually only played a little bit of the demo, but super interesting. It's from the same people who did, uh, Far Lone Sails, which is a game that I absolutely love. And Herdlings is - it's this really interesting, like melancholic third person game about herding these sort of like… weird where the wild things are looking creatures. Very interesting game.
Loading: Is that the one where you gather a bunch of birds?
Babaloga: No. That's Flock.
Loading: Okay.
Babaloga: Herdlings is - they look like where the wild things are.
Loading: Interesting. I think this year was, like, kind of weirdly sparse for games. Like, there were some very good games.
Babaloga: But Haste was this year, and I will say Haste… another one that that kicks ass up and down the field. I love Haste so much.
Loading: It's true. I've seen him.
Babaloga: If you like - if you like a game about going fast, you will like Haste. Haste is a game about going fast, and it absolutely nails everything that is good about going fast in games. And I genuinely gave a presentation about Haste at one point in the semester. And the subtitle of that presentation is “Why Sonic is a punk bitch who wouldn't know speed if it blasted past him at 140 km/hr”.
Loading: Accurate.
Babaloga: Listen, I know this will be hard to believe for any Sonic fans listening to this or reading the transcript. I don't actually have any ill will towards Sonic, but I do think that Haste does a much better job at being a game about going fast than any of the 3D Sonic games.
Loading: Well, so - so what Haste - because I've seen you play a lot of Haste - what Haste sort of weirdly reminds me of is something like high speed Subway Surfers.
Babaloga: The main gameplay of it is actually borrowed directly from Tiny Wings. I don't know if it's inspired by it, but it is like it is very directly Tiny Wings in that you like… you adjust your angle to, to match the angle of the ground so that you don't lose momentum when you hit the ground. But by putting it in 3D, you get like complex terrain. And you force the player to do like… it's sort of like the way parkour people talk about parkour, where it's like parkour is not really a physical thing. It's a mental thing. It's about charting your path through the environment. Like Haste nails that. Haste is forcing you to chart your path through the environment and then, like it takes care of the physical side of it, right? Like, you don't actually have to be running. It's like they isolated the mental part of doing parkour and made a game out of it. And it's really cool. So yeah, I think those would be my two big ones. Haste and Herdlings. Uh, for 2025, although I have not played, I have not finished Silksong, I have not finished Hades 2 and I have not even started Expedition 33. So all of the games that are stacking up to be like this year's big games of the year, I have not yet finished. So in five years, in 2030, when we are giving out the 2025 Game Awards, my list of important games from this year might look very different.
Loading: Expedition 33 is so up my alley and I - my computer cannot run that game and I am dying.
Babaloga: It can't run it at all?
Loading: No.
Babaloga: What's the minimum spec on it?
Loading: It's like two gigabytes below VRam of, for the minimum specs. It would destroy my graphics card.
Babaloga: You can't - could you maybe do - because I know it's turn based; I don't know if there are real time elements - but could you maybe find like, a game streaming solution just for that?
Loading: Maybe I'll look into it.
Babaloga: All right. So yeah. Do we want to get into the…?
Loading: Yeah. So one one of the easiest ways I think we could break this up is the best game of every month.
Babaloga: Okay. I was thinking we could get a little - I mean, that is definitely like an unusual way of of structuring a game show, or a game awards show.
Loading: Um, yeah.
Babaloga: I'm good to go with that. But I am wondering if maybe there are… we could we could go through another couple ideas.
Loading: I'm looking at January. It's kind of stacked 
Babaloga: Really? Yeah.
Loading: There's at least like three or four games here that I'm like, hm. So in January of 2020, Monster Hunter World Iceborne - that's the DLC for Monster Hunter World.
Babaloga: I - okay, right off the bat, I don't know if I would count that. That's a DLC.
Loading: That's fair. Uh… Arknights came out, which is a gacha I've heard is good, but I… am hesitant to put that on a best games list.
Babaloga: I have literally never played it and I don't - I may have heard the name at some point, but I'm not going to make it my game… of the year.
Loading: The Japanese release of Yakuza: Like a Dragon.
Babaloga: Whoa whoa whoa. Hang on, Loading. Stop the presses, stop the presses! Kentucky Route Zero.
Loading: I haven't gotten there yet!
Babaloga: Yeah, but it's more important. Act five of Kentucky Route Zero came out January 28th, 2020. We have our winner for the month, Loading.
Loading: We do, but I want to highlight all the games. Tokyo Mirage Sessions Fe encore. I hear that game is pretty good. Yeah, Journey to the Savage Planet was good. Uh, Coffee Talk came out. Uh, that's something I've heard, uh, from friends that are more in the -
Babaloga: In the visual novel space?
Loading: - in the visual novel space that that game is excellent. Patapon 2 apparently got a remaster that year for the PS4, so.
Babaloga: That game looks like a lot of fun. I've never played it.
Loading: Yes, uh, there's a spiritual successor coming out that I'm keeping an eye on. Uh, so Kentucky Route Zero was the best game of January?
Babaloga: Yeah.
Loading: Apparently I haven't played it.
Babaloga: You I, I was about to say you should because I think people should play good games. I don't know if you would like it.
Loading: I don't think I would.
Babaloga: I mean, I think it's definitely worth giving a shot, but I wouldn't be surprised if you were like, eh, it just wasn't for me.
Loading: Yeah, I think that's probably what's going to end up happening with it. It's such an interesting game, but at the same time it's point and click adventures. I kind of struggle with them.
Babaloga: It's not a… Here's the thing about it. It's not a point and click puzzle game, which I think is where a lot of people get hung up on point and click adventures. Like there - there are zero puzzle elements in Kentucky Route Zero, or there are, there are a few puzzle elements, but they're like incidental minigame puzzles. They're not. They're not like point and click adventure style puzzles.
Loading: I also, somewhat paradoxically, as a big JRPG fan, uh, struggle with longer cutscenes and games that have a lot of cutscenes and things like that.
Babaloga: It's not really like.,, I would argue that there are very few cutscenes. Basically like each chapter ends with a cutscene and that's about it.
Loading: All right, I'll try. Kentucky Route Zero.
Babaloga: I suppose it's all - it's mostly dialogue. Like structurally, it's more like a visual novel than anything else. Except it doesn't have the presentation of a visual novel. It has the presentation of a point and click adventure.
Loading: I've also just got out of visual novel hell, uh, so I might keep away for a while.
Babaloga: Put it on your calendar for a year from today.
Loading: Yeah, a large part of, um, Limbus Company, that had been playing a lot of recently, uh, is visual novel, which.
Babaloga: I refuse to understand any more about this game than the extremely little that I already do.
Loading: Understandable.
Babaloga: You're - uh, apparently it contains within it visual novels. That's fine. Some games do that.
Loading: And also real novels. But we can't talk about them. We're not talking about that.
Babaloga: No, I already know about the real novels. Oh, wow. Florence came out in February of 2020.
Loading: We're not at. Okay. So. Kentucky Route Zero in January?
Babaloga: Yeah, we decided our winner for January. We can move on.
Loading: All right. What happened? Granblue Fantasy Versus. Now, that is notably not Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising, which I think is my favorite fighting game that's currently active. Uh, Granblue Fantasy Versus came out and fucking died on the vine because it didn't have what's called NETcode or it didn't have, like, rollback NETcode, uh, which is a fucking death sentence for fighting games. This was like the last possible moment games could get away with that. And then the fucking pandemic hit.
Babaloga: Um.
Loading: And so that.
Babaloga: Yeah, they, they gambled the wrong thing at the wrong time.
Loading: They really did. Uh, Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising came out like two years later, and that game is phenomenal.
Babaloga: Oh, Florence Florence did not come out 2020. It came out for Windows. And NX. What is NX? That's not the Nintendo Switch, right? It is the Nintendo Switch.
Loading: Warriors Orochi four came out a game that I weirdly did play this year. I had a whole Orochi Warrior's face. That game is fucking insane. That's, that's one of those, like, Warriors games where you're just carving through dudes.
Babaloga: What is, what is NS? Okay. Hang on. Uh, listeners slash readers. Um. So. Florence. February 20 13 - February 13th, 2020. It says it released for Windows and NX. When you go to the Florence page on Wikipedia, it says on February 13th it released for Mac OS and NS as in snake versus X, as in xylophone, uh, and Windows. I don't know if NS... Okay. No it is, it is Nintendo Switch. It says here in the full article. So the, the article for 2020 in games still refers to the Nintendo Switch as its development name, the NX, which is kind of funny.
Loading: I'm sorry. Breaking news. It appears that there was a Dark Crystal video game released in 2020.
Babaloga: Yeah. Wait, you didn't know that?
Loading: I didn't know about this.
Babaloga: Yeah. It's crazy. It was - it corresponded with the Netflix series.
Loading: Was it good?
Babaloga: I have no idea. Uh, wasn't it like a, a tactical RPG?
Loading: Uh, Demon Ex Machina came out this year. Uh, in February.
Babaloga: In the month that - yeah.
Loading: Yeah, in the month of February. Daemon Ex Machina is, um, it's, it's one of the better Armored Corps esque games. Uh, it's got, like, a lot of that verticality and a lot of the speed that Armored Corps has, uh, not nearly to the extent of Armored Corps 4 and 5, because Armored Corps 4 is an insane game for insane people, a game that is comparable to the speed of Haste, uh, when you're several, like, runs in or when you're, like, at the end of a run. And it's just like that all the time. Daemon Ex Machina is not that game, though. Daemon Ex Machina is like a weird one. It's not incredible, but I think it is a notable game. Oh, Samurai Shodown came out in February. That game is. That's another fighting game. That's one that's like, notoriously slow in a really interesting way.
Babaloga: So the one that caught my eye when I was first looking at this list of games was Sayonara Wild Hearts.
Loading: Yes.
Babaloga: But that game actually launched in 2019 on most platforms. It only launched on Xbox One in 2020. So I don't think it should count.
Loading: Okay. Samurai Shodown came out on Switch that year, so that also doesn't count. So what does that leave us with?
Babaloga: Let's see. Okay. Two Point Hospital. Now granted, I think that's the console release of Two Point Hospital. And I have never played Two Point Hospital, but I have a friend who plays quite a bit of it. So given that it's the only game that I recognize on this list. I mean, Metro Redux, but that's for the Switch.
Loading: I think Daemon Ex Machina is probably my pick here.
Babaloga: Hey, Loading, I think I've identified a problem with going month by month. There's some months that - just don't - don't have any games.
Loading: That we're going to be grasping at straws here, Baba. We're gonna have to fucking live with this.
Babaloga: That's - all right. If that's part of the structure, that’s part of the structure.
Loading: This is okay. Daemon Ex Machina. This is the Windows release, because it released on Switch first, which is an interesting game on Switch because it has motion controls on that sort of game, which is weird. So that is eliminated. Granblue Fantasy Versus is our current frontrunner, it looks like.
Babaloga: What about Dota Underlords? Is that any good? I've never heard of it.
Loading: I've never heard of this.
Babaloga: It's an auto battler.
Loading: It's the Dota auto battler. It appears.
Babaloga: But it's a Valve game. Like, that's gotta count for something. There's a One Punch Man - no - so wait. Yeah, that's the end of February. I keep losing the line between February and March. I don't know, honestly, at this point, I feel like I just give it to Sayonara Wild Hearts for me personally, because nothing else on here is something I've even played.
Loading: I'm giving it to Warriors Orochi or Orochi Four Ultimate. 
Babaloga: All right. I'll trust you.
Loading: Uh, what's in March?
Babaloga: March? Uh, Symphony of the Night. Wow. I thought that game -
Loading: Oh, Murder by Numbers! Murder by Numbers is an actual good fucking pic here.
Babaloga: Why is it seven? Oh, because it came out on March 5th for the Switch and March 6th for Windows. That's funny. Pathologic 2. How was that? Was that any good?
Loading: Uh, 2019.
Babaloga: Oh, that's just - 
Loading: The PS4 release.
Babaloga: The PS4 release. Yeah.
Loading: Pathologic two is excellent. I've heard.
Babaloga: Uh, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, if you like Hollow Knight - this is that.
Loading: Oh, the. The remake of Pokémon Mystery Dungeon Rescue Team.
Babaloga: I would like to apologize to any Ori and the Will of the Wisp fans. I just want to make it clear that that was a joke. Or any Ori and the Will of the Wisps developers.
Loading: Yeah.
Babaloga: Um.
Loading: Dead or School for the PS4.
Babaloga: Oh, actually, no. Sorry. Hang on. March has it's - it's one because this was going to be my game of the year candidate until I remembered something else that came out this year. Um, Half-Life Alyx.
Loading: I saw that. Let me see if anything can beat Half-Life Alyx here.
Babaloga: I… you would be pretty fucking hard pressed.
Loading: I know. Uh, Bubble Bobble 4 Friends?
Babaloga: I know, I know, a lot of people can't play it because the tech is prohibitively expensive, and that does suck. But unfortunately, the game is that good.
Loading: Baba. Baba, there is a contender here.
Babaloga: [Doubtful] All right. What is it?
Loading:  Persona 5 Royal. 
Babaloga: Nope. 
Loading: No?? I think I put Persona 5 Royal here. Also Cooking Mama Cook Star, the game that would brick your Nintendo Switch is this month.
Babaloga: This is, um… I think this is going to be a tricky situation because I have not played Persona 5 Royal, and I'm going to assume you haven't played Half-Life Alyx. 
Loading: I've not played in Half-Life Alyx.
Babaloga: Yeah. So we only have to resolve that with how emphatic we are that our game wins this year. And I'm, I'm extremely emphatic that my game wins.
Loading: I- I think I'll give it to Half-Life Alyx just because Persona 5 Royal is the remake of Persona 5.
Babaloga: Oh, it's a fucking remake. Uh, yeah, that shouldn't even.
Loading: It's like the - they do this thing where they release the original game, then they have like an updated edited game with a bunch of new content.
Babaloga: There's a game here called Paper Beasts that was apparently a PS VR exclusive. That looks really interesting. Oh, no. It came out on Windows. Presumably later. So that's cool. I might check that out. Paper Beast. All right, I think that's I think we got, uh, March sorted. Let’s move onto April.
Loading: Oh, wait. Neo 2 came out.
Babaloga: Okay.
Loading: And that game is also quite good. We should shout it out.
Babaloga: Neo two.
Loading: April. My Friend Pedro came out in April.
Babaloga: Oh, congratulations to your friend Pedro.
Loading: Oh, wait. No, they came out on PS4 in April. God damn this list. Final Fantasy VII remake came out in April.
Babaloga: I'll trust you on that because Chimera Squad also came out in April. And I know that that game was awful. Okay, that game is not awful, but that game is bad. Telling Lies came out in April, though, and I've heard good things.
Loading: Oh, Cloudpunk came out. That's an interesting game. Are you familiar with this game?
Babaloga: Uh, I feel like I've heard of it.
Loading: Do you, like, drive a sci fi taxi?
Babaloga: That sounds cool.
Loading: Oh, no. The regrettable Trials of Mana.
Babaloga: Oh, wait, but loading. Octopath Traveler came out for Stadia.
Loading: Woof. I had a friend of mine who was all in on Stadia.
Babaloga: Oh, wait. Sorry. That was -  no, that was still in April. Them's Fightin’ Herds?
Loading: He, he fucking unironically loves the stadia controller and has been, like, lamenting that his is dying.
Babaloga: I mean, it looks like a decent controller. I don't think the controller was the problem with Stadia.
Loading: Oh, Legends of Runeterra came out.
Babaloga: Yeah, it's a - it's a decent controller. It's got the PlayStation configuration, but it's shaped like the Switch Pro controller. It seems like a nice controller.
Loading: Them's Fightin’ Herds, though.
Babaloga: It's a funny title. I know nothing about it though.
Loading: Little Pony fan fighting game.
Babaloga: Really?
Loading: Yeah. Yeah, that's what Them's Fightin’ Herds is.
Babaloga: Oh, you know what? Now that I look closer at the key art, I see it. Yeah, that's really funny.
Loading: It's one of the ones that's like, here's an insane game that came out because there's a lot of insane fighting games like the Les Miz one.
Babaloga: Yeah. Uh, Legends of Runeterra also came out this month.
Loading: Yeah. Streets of Rage 4, Legends of Runeterra.
Babaloga: Had you already mentioned it?
Loading: I, I had.
Babaloga: Oh my bad. Phantasy Star Online… 2. Space Engineers.
Loading: Do we give it to my friend or… no? My Friend Pedro had already come out.
Babaloga: I'm. I'm willing to defer to you on this one.
Loading: I don't think I can give it to Legends of Runeterra. That was a very good game that it was good.
Babaloga: Okay. Snowrunner, what’s Snowrunner?
Loading: Void Bastards is in May!
Babaloga: Oh, yeah. We're in May now.
Loading: Deep Rock Galactic, Hell Taker, Void Bastards.
Babaloga: John Wick Hex was a - was a Bithell games. That's the, the same guy slash studio that did, uh, Thomas was Alone, but very different game.
Loading: Golf with your Friends.
Babaloga: Mega - Super Mega Baseball Three.
Loading: Umurangi Generation.
Babaloga: Umurangi Generation is a good ass game.
Loading: Monster tra- MMM, Monster Train came out.
Babaloga: I'll. You know, I think I will defer to you on this one as well, unless I see something… Whoa! BioShock the collection.
Loading: This is actually really hard for me. This month had both deep Rock Galactic and Monster Train.
Babaloga: Shantae and the Seven Sirens.
Loading: I cannot overstate how much I love either of these games. Deep Rock Galactic I've put a ton of time into, and I really love that game, and it's a really unique game that I try to - I compare a lot of other games to it. Monster Train is the best deckbuilding roguelike I've ever played, which is a bold statement and a hot take.
Babaloga: But Loading. May, May was when the Shantae - Shantae game came out.
Loading: Oh you're right.
Babaloga: You know Shantae? Shantae, the platformers whose only unique selling point is that every single character in them is a scantily clad woman.
Loading: I know people who, like, die on that, who, like, die by that - those games.
Babaloga: Yeah. Like, I always felt like I must be missing something. Because you look at these games and they don't look that good, and they don't look like they play that well, but people fucking go rabid for them.
Loading: I've heard they play really well. I've heard they, like, quietly, just are really good to play.
Babaloga: It might be the, um. What's that? What's the furry game that unfortunately kicks ass?
Loading: Oh, Atlas.
Babaloga: Yeah, it might, it might be an Atlas situation.
Loading: Atlas situation. I regret to inform you that, that was what I didn't want to put on my 2020 list. I did play a lot of Atlas this year. That game fucking rips and rocks and it is horny as hell. I think I give it to Monster Train.
Babaloga: Elder Scrolls Blades came out for Nintendo Switch.
Loading: Isn't that the mobile one?
Babaloga: Yeah.
Loading: I'm giving it Monster Train.
Babaloga: Okay, wait. Deep Rock Galactic came out that year. That month? That's crazy.
Loading: That's why I'm so torn on Monster Train.
Babaloga: I see.
Loading: Yeah.
Babaloga: Oh, shit. June is where Valorant comes from.
Loading: Valorant, The Outer Worlds. Okay, on Switch.
Babaloga: Last of Us part two was June. I never played it though.
Loading: We Were Here Together.
Babaloga: I don't think I knew you yet. Oh, it's the title of a game I see.
Loading: Samurai Shodown for Windows…
Babaloga: Kingdom Hearts Dark Road, a Kingdom Hearts mobile game.
Loading: Oh, Duke - your favorite! Duke Nukem.
Babaloga: Oh, boy. My favorite guy, Duken - Dukem Nukem.
Loading: Dukem nukem!
Babaloga: Whoa. There's - there’s - there's a game here called Brigandine: The Legend of Runersia. It's like, whoa, guys! Show down!
Loading: Guys, you gotta fuckin pump the brakes on that one!
Babaloga: Guys, your title rips too much ass!
Loading: This title is too goooood!
Babaloga: Tell me more about Brigandine: The Legend of Runersia!
Loading: Oh, Burnout Paradise got a remaster. I don't want to count that, but that game fucking honestly kicks ass.
Babaloga: For this month, barring remasters and whatever, and rereleases -
Loading: Oh, wait, Last of Us part two.
Babaloga: - I honestly might give it - well, okay, I did not play Last of Us Part two, but that is probably the correct choice. But other games I've played, I would give it to Clubhouse Games 51Worldwide Classics.
Loading: How many games are in that?
Babaloga: Fifty one… worldwide classics.
Loading: Worldwide classics?!
Babaloga: And one hundred worldwide terrible games. No, there's only fifty one. They're all worldwide classics. That's what's so impressive about it. What's Ninjala?
Loading: Oh, We Were Here Tog -
Babaloga: Oh, I remember Ninjala! People were calling it like a Splatoon rip off.
Loading: Oh, right. This game! This game came out?
Babaloga: Yeah, it came out in June of 2020?
Loading: I don't think this game is real.
Babaloga: Well, probably not anymore.
Loading: Probably.
Babaloga: All right, let's, let's give it to Last of Us and move on.
Loading: Yep. Uh, TrackMania.
Babaloga: Super- Oh. That's console Superliminal.
Loading: They put Katherine on the switch. Uh Crosscode?
Babaloga: I mean, Katherine originally came out on, like, the Wii, didn't it?
Loading: Yeah. No, I think it was PS3.
Babaloga: Um, no. Well, but it was -
Loading: Did you ever play Crosscode?
Babaloga: - I know it released on the Wii because I remember watching those, like, weird, like Wii Nintendo News segments about it, which is really funny. Say what?
Loading: Did you play Cross code? Cross code. 
Babaloga: Cross code? No. Don't even know.
Loading: It's a cool little game. Uh, it looks like this is a, uh…
Babaloga: An action RPG. I don't play a lot of action RPGs.
Loading: What is Bloodstained Curse of the Moon 2...
Babaloga: Carrion came out that month?
Loading: I love Bloodstained, what is Curse of the Moon 2? Oh, wait, Carrion came out? Oh, that's a good game.
Babaloga: Cat Quest and Cat Quest 2. I don't know. I don't know. Fucking going month by month is so hard. I don't know any of these games. What did you make us do this, Loading?
Loading: Because I know some of these games.
Babaloga: Family… Death Strand- Oh, wait. Death Stranding!
Loading: Oh, Superhot: Mind Control Delete!
Babaloga: Wait. What year did. Yeah. Uh. Mind Control Delete - heh? huh?
Loading: Yes. It's the follow up to Super Hot!
Babaloga: [Quietly] Super!
Loading: [Quietly] Hot!
Babaloga: [Quietly] Hot.
Loading: [Quietly] Super. 
Babaloga: Paper Mario the Origami King came out.
Loading: That's a fun game I've heard.
Babaloga: Oh, Ghost of Tsushima.
Loading: Oh, Ghost of Tsushima’s strong.
Babaloga: I never played it. I never had a Playst- I did have a PlayStation four, but I don't use it.
Loading: I played a little bit of it.
Babaloga: All right, I'll let you decide. I'm moving on to August.
Loading: I mean, it's objectively correct to say Ghost of Tsushima, but I'm gonna give it to Carrion.
Babaloga: All right. You do you. Wow. Okay, August of 2020 is pretty stacked.
Loading: Fall Guys.
Babaloga: Actually, I know what my game of the August of 2020 is, and it's not one that you're gonna find on this list.
Loading: Risk of Rain 2.
Babaloga: It's blaseball. 

[Silence]
Loading: Okay. Fuck off. With all due respect, fuck off.
Babaloga: I mean, am I wrong?
Loading: Yeah. Risk of Rain 2 came out this month. What the fuck are you talking about?
Babaloga: Yeah! Blaseball - blaseball came out this month. What are you talking about?
Loading: I'm talking about fucking Risk of Rain 2!
Babaloga: Are you going to tell me that Risk of Rain 2 is a better game than blaseball?
Loading: Yes!!
Babaloga: All right, that's… an interesting take.
[8 seconds of silence]
Loading: Hass keep this in.
Babaloga: Yeah. No, absolutely do. The people have to know!
Loading: People have to know how long we sat in silence!
Babaloga: No, the people have to know the - the objectively wrong takes that Loading has.
Loading: Oh, wait. Spiritfarer was also this month.
Babaloga: Spiritfarer was this month. And it's a strong contender. But it's not blaseball.
Loading: I didn't play Spiritfarer. Blaseball itself is not…Blaseball the community was-
Babaloga: Hey, Loading, I conceded last like six months to you!
Loading: [Begrudgingly] That's true. This one goes to blaseball.
Babaloga: I can't believe I had to pull that card to get you to allow blaseball to be the game of August of 2020.
Loading: I thought we had separate lists.
Babaloga: Innnnsane.
Loading: Do you think season one of blaseball was the best?
Babaloga: I mean, we're not judging it by, like, the game that was run that year.
Loading: We're judging by what was in 2020 -
Babaloga: Because like a lot of these games, they got like content updates and stuff after release, right, like -
Loading: Rhey did.
Babaloga: That's, that's not really the criterion. The whole point of going back after five years - 
Loading: That's true.
Babaloga: -is to judge the entirety of the game. That's part of why it's weird that we're going month by month.
Loading: That's true. Anyway, September Crusader Kings 3. I like that game a lot.
Babaloga: I have no opinion on that game. Let me see if there's anything - the Avicii game came out!
Loading: What is the Avicii - 
Babaloga: Was he still alive by then? 
Loading: Is that Chris Pratt? 
Babaloga: No, “In Memory of Swedish DJ Avicii.” What? No, that's, that's Avicii. The picture of the guy on the Avicii game is Avicii.
Loading: Are you sure that's not Chris Pratt? I'm pretty sure that's Chris Pratt. 
Babaloga: You know, you know Avicii?
Loading: Everyone Google Chris Pratt, and then Google Avicii.
Babaloga: Oh, uh, Hades came out in September.
Loading: Spelunky 2.
Babaloga: Hades though.
Loading: I know, but I'm highlighting all the things.
Babaloga: Yeah, but Hades though. Genshin Impact.
Loading: Well, we have our winner, you know.
Babaloga: Serious Sam 4. This time he's serious.
Loading: Oh, Tennis World Tour 2, actually.
Babaloga: Wow. Super Mario 3D All-Stars. It is kind of crazy, like stepping through game history like this and being like, oh, yeah, all those things were happening simultaneously. Like, I didn't play Hades on launch.
Loading: I'm doing it month by month because every month is like a snapshot, right? If we did the whole year, we, we'd lose out on some of these games.
Babaloga: Oh, the Art of Rally. I did play a little bit of the Art of Rally. There was a video from someone who really loved it that convinced me to pick it up. And then I played it a little bit and I was like, this game is not for me.
Loading: The video game adaptation of Wingspan.
Babaloga: Yes, I saw that as well. It's a, it's a pretty good video game adaptation. It is still an adaptation. I don't know if I would count it.
Loading: Yeah. Oh. BPM: Bullets per Minute.
Babaloga: I have heard of that game.
Loading: That game rips and rocks and it's not for me.
Babaloga: That's the rhythm shooter, right? I am interested, I might try and play that at some point. I am interested in rhythm games and unusual formats.
Loading: It is a thoroughly unique rhythm game. I think this has to go to Hades though.
Babaloga: It's got to go to Hades. I mean, come on, it kicks ass. Overcrowd: A Commute 'Em Up? Oh, that doesn't look that good. It looks like somebody pissed.
Loading: Uh. October-December. October.
Babaloga: October specifically.
Loading: Uh, Crash Bandicoot 4?
Babaloga: Uh, Nickelodeon Kart Racers 2: Grand Prix.
Loading: Star Wars: Squadrons, a surprisingly good game. I need to play more dogfighting games...
Babaloga: Ben 10 Power Trip. They were still making Ben 10 games in 2020?
Loading: Next episode we'll talk about Ben 10!
Babaloga: Okay? I mean, we can. You would have to do most of the talking.
Loading: I don't know anything about Ben 10!
Babaloga: Hang on. Actually wait, we have maybe a black sheep candidate this month because - 
Loading: Torchlight III?
Babaloga: No, the Jackbox Party Pack 7 came out this month and that's honestly maybe one of the strongest packs. Yeah.
Loading: That’s maybe the best Jackbox.
Loading: Oh, Noita also came out though.
Babaloga: Noita. This title refers to more than one page. All right, hang on. Oh, yes, I know of this. I never played it. Another Shantae game. Oh, it's a remake. Wow. They were really going hard on Shantae.
Loading: Oh, Leisure Shoe - Suit Larry: Wet Dreams Dry Twice. I know that was on your game of the year shortlist.
Babaloga: Uh, wasn't that the previous month?
Loading: We're on October.
Babaloga: Yeah. September 15th.
Loading: Monster Prom 2?
Babaloga: I'm sure it's good.
Loading: Yeah. Oh, Ghostrunner. Ghostrunner is an interesting game. More than it's a game I like. That's a game for like, true sickos. Ghostrunner - Ghostrunner is like, what if Mirror's Edge? But you had a sword?
Babaloga: That sounds cool.
Loading: It is cool. I didn't jive with the controls, and in a game like that, you need to jive with the controls or you're going to struggle. Pikmin 3 Deluxe.
Babaloga: Pikmin! Okay, I will say it is a rerelease,  and so it's not eligible, but Pikmin 3 Deluxe is a really strong rerelease of Pikmin 3. It added the local co-op and it did something else that I don't - it added like difficulty modes. It's just like a bunch of really nice quality of life things. And Pikmin 3 genuinely? Extremely good game. Like I will die on that hill. Nobody is trying to kill me on that hill, but I'll die on that hill by my own hand.
Loading: Sorry, Hill. All right, before we give this to Jackbox Party Pack 7, which I think is where this is going, let's pick apart the games. Quiplash is a classic game. Devil in the Details…
Babaloga: Oh yeah, Devil's in the Details is probably one of the weaker ones.
Loading: ChampedUp, which is like a top tier. That's a top tier one.
Babaloga: ChampedUp is really strong. Talking Points, I think, is like a dark horse. Like it's an underrated gem.
Loading: Talking Points is group dependent.
Babaloga: Yes, but when it works, it really works. And I think you, you know, sometimes especially in a pack like this, it's fine for a game to be group dependent because it's better to have it for the groups for whom it works than to not have it at all.
Loading: Is Talking Points the one where you do a pitch?
Babaloga: You - no, no - you're thinking of Patently Stupid. Talking Points, you do a presentation and somebody else is putting the presentation together for you as you're delivering it.
Loading: Okay, that's like a hard improv game. Yeah. And Blather ‘Round, which I know that you love. I love less… 
Babaloga: Blather ‘Round. Okay. I - it has recently come to my attention that many of the people that I regularly play Jackbox Games have been secretly harboring a resentment towards Blather ‘Round… that, that has only been building the more we play.
Loading: Yeah, because every time they, they interact with you, you're like, well, of course we'll play Blather ‘Round
Babaloga: Yeah. I'm like, well, we all love Blather ‘Round and everybody sort of doesn't say anything. But, but yes, I really love Blather ‘Round. I think Blather ‘Round - this is my genuine take - I think Blather ‘Round is the best game that Jackbox Games has made. Um, I think it's it's it's a little light on content. It would be better if there was just more variety in the prompts you could get, but it's a really strong game.
Loading: Hass has DM me in discord with the take.
Babaloga: Wait - 
Loading: Hass has -
Babaloga: Dish! Throw Hass under the bus!
Loading: Hass said, and I quote, “Blather ‘Round is a meh game”.
Babaloga: Yeah, see, these are the kinds of things that the, the people who I thought were my friends are too cowardly to tell me. These are the things they won't say to my face.
Loading: I think Blather ‘Round is a game… that you play at a polite Christmas party, right? It's like - it feels like something like charades or something, which is what they say on the Wikipedia page, where it's like, it feels like a game that you do in person, and it's like, oh, we've got our - we put the words in a hat and then we shuffle and draw and we do that, you know, and Blather ‘Round, I think feels a lot more like that than a lot of the other games.
Babaloga: I, I mean, I think you're right that that's the family of games that it falls into.
Loading: Yeah.
Babaloga: I think where the strength of the concept lies - and there's like there's a lot of other really strong games like the, the, the core sort of interaction that taps into is the same as, like the interaction that Codenames taps into, which is like trying to get a lot of meaning out of a limited word set. Like that is a - that is an interesting dynamic.
Loading: Yes.
Babaloga: And I think Blather ‘Round constructs it into an interesting game. I think maybe people are a little overexposed to it at this point. People who know me, um, because I can't get enough of Blather ‘Round and that's, that's maybe a me thing more than it is a feature.
Loading: That’s a you - let me be - let me be clear. That's a you issue.
Babaloga: Yeah. So maybe I think maybe the problems that people have with Blather ‘Round are actually problems they have with me. And that's okay. I'm willing to take this bullet for Blather ‘Round.
Loading: It's the - it's the hair shirt you wear.
Babaloga: I don't know what that means. And I don't want to.
Loading: It's - it's a reference to a son- don't worry about it. Uh, should we give - anyway, this month, this month goes to Noita.
Babaloga: No, this month goes to Jackbox Party Pack 7.
Loading: This month does go to Jackbox Box Party Pack 7.
Babaloga: October…
Loading: October… November.
Babaloga: November… Jurassic World Evolution… that game was bad.
Loading: Tropico 6… Borderlands 3…
Babaloga: Dirt 5. Hell yeah. They made five whole dirts. This one's called sandy loam. Uh, Fortnite Battle Royale.
Loading: Xbox Series X and S. We're gonna - We see a lot of Xbox Series X/S.
Babaloga: Oh, yeah, because a lot of the games that launched... Okay, so we had a console launch in November. Uh, did we have two console launches because we are seeing a lot of PS5 stuff as well?
Loading: Have you played Manifold Garden?
Babaloga: I haven't, but I own it. It's been, it's been in my backlog for a while.
Loading: That game's incredible to watch.
Babaloga: Ooh. Now. Okay. The Pathless came out in November of this year. That's a pretty good game.
Loading: There's an Observer remake?
Babaloga: I will admit I'm not as crazy about The Pathless as I think a lot of people are. A lot … of a lot of people who are, who are big fans of The Pathless. It sort of flew under the radar when it launched. So I don't mean to say that it got like all this acclaim.
Loading: Sorry. November is the worldwide release of Yakuza: Like a Dragon.
Babaloga: Okay, if that's, if that's your truth, then say it. I don't see anything on this list that supersedes it.
Loading: You don't think Just Dance 2021 deserves to win?
Babaloga: Well, not enough to fight you on it. Bugsnax did come out this month.
Loading: Oh, Bugsnax.
Babaloga: I’m not nominating Bugsnax. 
Loading: Think. I think Bugsnax might go over it. Hyrule Warriors Age of Calamity.
Babaloga: Astro's Playroom which was the - the - the predecessor to Astrobot.
Loading: Kombat 11: Ultimate.
Babaloga: Fuser. Fuser? I hardly know her. 
Loading: [Forced laugh]
Babaloga: Oh wait, it's kind of crazy that the Falconeer came out the same month as Pathless because they're, they’re both games about having a Falcon.
Loading: Is that what Pathless is about?
Babaloga: Yeah, Pathless is the one where you go fast and you have a falcon friend and you have a bow. It's from the - it's from half of the team that made, uh, Journey. Like the Journey people split up and half of them went made Sky: Children of the Light. And the, the other half of them went and made the Pathless.
Loading: Shout up to Sky: Children of the Light, a - a game out editor fucking loves.
Babaloga: A game our editor - and Hass you can cut this out, ‘cause I know that you have that power anyway - a game, a game that our editor hides from their steam list, so as - so as to conceal the number of hours that they have in it from anybody who might be looking at their steam games.
Loading: Hass, how many hours have you put into Sky Children of the Light? Hass? We're waiting.
Babaloga: You know. Normal amount.
Loading: Normal, normal number. [Hass posted a censored screenshot] Hass. There's a comma in that number. Hass, there's a comma in that number!! Hass, I think that's more time than I've ever put into a game! Is that first number a “1”?
Hass [Distorted]: [Defending herself]
Loading: That first number is not a one. It sounds like. I think Bugsnax takes it. Bugsnax and Yakuza: Like a Dragon. We'll give it to both of them.
Babaloga: Why? If you're gonna - if you're going to be taking over this month, you gotta choose one, buddy.
Loading: Do you have a pick for this month?
Babaloga: I did not play either of those games. You gotta choose one.
Loading: Yakuza: Like a Dragon.
Babaloga: All right, that's our pick.
Loading: All right. December.
Babaloga: December! Destiny 2? Oh, for the next generation consoles.
Loading: Immortals Fenyx Rising.
Babaloga: Ooh! I know one that shouldn't win. Drawn to Life: Two Realms. A legacy sequel to some really good games.
Loading: I thought… you hated Drawn to Life?
Babaloga: What?1
Loading: I thought you hated Drawn to Life 2… Realms?
Babaloga: I feel like you - It sounds like you've maybe half paid attention to a lot of things I've said about Drawn to Life.
Loading: I thought you hated Drawn to Life: Two…. Realms.
Babaloga: Oh, I did hate Drawn to Life: Two Realms. Well, you know what? I honestly didn't play that much of it. But I played a little bit of it, and I just - I heard a lot of, a lot of bad about it. But then, like, I was busy and never got around to playing it. Honestly, it might be really good and maybe it's not fair for me to judge it so harshly.
Loading: So this is a pick that… I'm looking at right now that definitely needed the five years test. Uh, Cyberpunk 2077.
Babaloga: Okay, but Omori came out on Christmas of this year.
Loading: No, shit! We gotta give it to Omori. Game of the year, Omori.
Babaloga: Game of the year, Omori?
Loading: Game of the year, Omori.
Babaloga: Okay. I would still say game of the year Blaseball.
Loading: Game of the year, Blaseball. Let's be real. Game of the year for us is blaseball. We are, in a word, biased.
Babaloga [Simultaneously] Baseball. 
Babaloga: I think we said the same word.
Loading: I think we said the same word. I think Omori wins December. 
Babaloga: Yeah. 
Loading: Have you played Omori? 
Babaloga: Nope. 
Loading: Good ass game.
Babaloga: I should play it eventually. Hang on. I'm gonna… I'm gonna run to the bathroom. Yeah. All right, I'll do that.
Loading: Piss! Hass, do you want to unmute while Baba is out?
Hass: [I honestly don’t remember what was said here except that I made fun of Baba’s pissing habits and how long it was taking him]
Loading: But look: sec - first thing you learn about Babaloga: he's a certified jackass. Second thing, you learn about Babaloga: pisses like a freight train. Pisses like a freak. It's like a shotgun blast. It's fucking coats the walls. It's revolting.
Babaloga: Hey, what up?
Hass, having not noticed Baba returning: [Probably still bullying Baba & egging Loading on]
Loading: Yeah, yeah. His bad - his bad piss accident.
Babaloga: Uh, h- hey, guys. It sounds like everyone was really cool to me while I was gone.
Loading: I gonna be real with you? We only got bad during the last, like, fifteen seconds.
[They laugh as Hass requests Baba to repeat “Damn boy, were you just frying chicken In there? For real, you piss loud as fuck” on recording]
Babaloga: Yeah, if you wanted me to - if you wanted the things you say to make it into the edit, you should record yourself.
Loading: Yeah, sorry Hass.
Babaloga: It's not that much. You literally just open audacity and start recording, and then you can like -
Loading: Anyway, what were you doing before you left?
Babaloga: Uh, we had just decided our game of the month. No, we just decided our game of the year 2020. I think, honestly, we might be done.
Loading: There's also the in December, the video game adaptation of George Orwell's Animal Farm.
Babaloga: That's… I do actually remember that. I don’t…
Loading: Everyone remembers when Orwell's Animal Farm came out, and it was a weirdly faithful recreation of Animal Farm, but it was a video game.
Babaloga: I, I never played it. I don't know anything about it, but I remember it coming out.
Loading: I watched, I watched like a Let's Play because I'm like, what the fuck is this.
Babaloga: Video game based film and TV? I believe Arcane… Did Arcane come out this year? No.
Loading: That's a bad category anyway.
Babaloga: Yeah, no, but it was, it was on. Um, there's there's a category at the Wikipedia page that's video game based film and television.
Loading: Oh, the Sonic the Hedgehog movie came out.
Babaloga: Wait, now I'm curious though. When did Arcane season one drop?
Loading: There was a limited animated web series for Nanjala.
Babaloga: That makes sense. Okay, it was 2021. Okay. Uh. What else? What still needs deciding. I feel like we've covered everything.
Loading: I think we've got everything. It's also an hour and eleven minutes into recording.
Babaloga: So that was the games of each month. And finally the game of the year 2020. The game of the year decision ended up being kind of a shoo in for us, admittedly. 
Loading: Yeah, second, second best game of the year. What do you think? Omori?
Babaloga: Yeah, let's, let's decide. That's, that's a good idea.
Loading: I think  Omori is - if you want to like weird deep cut contenders, I think you put Omori up there. Do you - you haven't played Omori, right? I remember what I wanted to say about it before you pissed. Omori is a really interesting case study in how far you can push the UI of RPG maker, if that makes sense.
Babaloga: Interesting. RPG… I didn't realize it was made in RPG maker.
Loading: That's the wild thing is that entire game is made in RPG maker.
Babaloga: I actually don't have a strong sense of what an RPG maker game even looks like.
Loading: Oh. You should.
Babaloga: Why?
Loading: As a game dev person, I think it'll serve you well.
Babaloga: Well. But why? Why would -
Loading: It's - it’s you know - you know how the fighting scenes of Lisa look? 
Babaloga: Nope. 
Loading: Uh, Lisa The Painful. 
Babaloga: Nope. 
Loading: Have you never seen Lisa The Painful? 
Babaloga: Nope. 
Loading: What about if you just look game -
Babaloga: Ok RPG maker looks…pretty… generic.
Loading: It - That's -Yeah. Have you seen Look Outside this year?
Babaloga: I don't know if you're asking a question in really weird way. Or asking a question about a game with a really weird title?
Loading: Have you seen the game Look Outside.
Babaloga: Uh, no.
Loading: Okay.
Babaloga: Wait. Maybe.
Loading: Wow. You're really not in this space, huh?
Babaloga: Look Outside. No, I've never even heard of this. Devolver Digital. Huh?
Loading: That's a good game. It's worth playing. Anyway, that's all the video games that came out. Fuck - thank you everyone for listening. Do you have anything to say? Baba?
Babaloga: Wait. We wait. We were about to pick a runner-up for the year.
Loading: Oh, yeah. Let's get our top four runner-ups.
Babaloga: Okay. I would say for me, it's in no particular order. Hades, Kentucky Route Zero... I'm just going to do three because four is a weird number to do. Three feels rounder.
Loading: I think I've got mine loaded. If you want me to do mine. 
Babaloga: Go for it. 
Loading: Monster Train. Omori. 
Babaloga: Okay. 
Loading: Hades. And I think the fourth one is gonna vex me.
Babaloga: The problem is, I know that I'm missing something.
Loading: Cyberpunk 2077!
Babaloga: Oh, Alyx! Of course.
Loading: Cyberpunk 2077 is going to be my fourth one. I have played all these games and I can vouch that they are all good.
Babaloga: Okay, I’m, I'm gonna say Half-Life Alyx. Uh, Kentucky Route Zero. Hades. Is there anything that I've missed… that I played on here?
Loading: Oh, Wasteland 3 was this year? What the fuck?
Babaloga: Did not play Doom Eternal… Do not play Good Job. I don't know, I feel like there's probably something that I played that I'm just completely forgetting.
Loading: Probably.
Babaloga: I don't know. I'm willing to call my list there. I think that a top four, including blaseball, is fine. It's a fine number of things, and they're in no particular order.
Loading: I think this was a good year, not a great year.
Babaloga: You know what I'd throw in Spiritfarer. I don't have, like, super strong feelings about Spiritfarer, but I'd throw it in to round out my top five.
Loading: Did you ever finish Spiritfarer?
Babaloga: No. I basically got a little bit bogged down in the… in the day to day of it.
Loading: I… I never played it just because it seems like something that's extremely not my jam. So yeah, we've arbiter all the video games. Anything else to say?
Babaloga: Yeah, it's, uh, there's… there's, um, there's leftover cake in the fridge if you want it.
Loading: Anything you want to plug?
Babaloga: Plug? Uh, I don't know. Check out my itch. See all the shitty half made games that I made this semester.
Loading: Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on. If we're gonna do that: we've beguney with the money.
Babaloga: Oh, well, you asked me if I wanted to plug anything!
Loading: All right, everyone who's got a little someone here to plug for you. What do we got, Baba?
Babaloga: It's - well, first of all, there's no money involved. So… bad intro. And second of all, I don't know. You can check out my itch if you want. Like…?
Loading: Check out Baba's itch. Buy our book.
Babaloga: Don't, don't check out my itch. All the games on there are bad.
Loading: Check out Baba's itch. Buy our books. Uh, How Bad a Day Can Be. Find it. We've given you all the clues. We're doney with the money.
Babaloga: All right.
Loading: Thank you. Fuck you. Goodbye.
Babaloga: Hey there, listeners. It's me still. Loading forgot that I did this last time and he did not expect me to do it again this time. I just - I want to say that you're all great, and thanks for listening or reading, even though we explicitly told you not to. Why can't you just follow directions for once in - [Recording cuts off]
