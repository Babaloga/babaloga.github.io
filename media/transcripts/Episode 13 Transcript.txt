Loading: My arm is cut off while holding a razor. When I examine it, is it a pale blue terrified of something. I lose my remaining arm the same way. So I set up my two arms like candelabras to decorate my room. My arms, even though they are dead, seem terrified of me. I love such flimsy manners more than any flowerpot. 


Hello. Welcome to the Don't Listen to This podcast. My name is Loading.


 Babaloga: [Sounding tired] Hi. I'm - uh - I'm - uh - I'm Babaloga.


 Loading: Today we've got a very special episode prepared for you. That's right! We - 


 Babaloga: Well -  Hang on, hang on. 'Cause we have some housekeeping. Uh, I'm sure some of you may have noticed that we accidentally skipped episode thirteen. Uh, that was not on purpose. We are not superstitious...building organizers. Uh, organiz - that's... Do you call people... who... set up...


 Loading: Architects.


 Babaloga: Architects! Yeah!


 Loading: We call them architect!


 Babaloga: The people who organize the buildings. Um, it was not on purpose. We did just accidentally miss thirteen. So we're - we're just going back. We're catching thirteen and then we will proceed as normal.


 Loading: All right. So we're going to watch this, uh, and we're gonna give a countdown. Baba, would you care to give the countdown?


 Babaloga: Well, how about we just do it on Time.is, the same way we do the sync? So we make sure that we're...


 Loading: Oh, yeah, yeah yeah. 


 Babaloga: ...sync'd up. At twenty five?


 Loading: Twenty five it is!


 Babaloga: All right.


 Loading: Go.


 Babaloga: All right. We got stars. The wizard is - 


 Loading: [Over top of Baba]: We got stars! It's the Universal logo! 
 
 Babaloga: The movie is "The Wizard". By the way.


 Loading: Baba, do you have food on you right now?


 Babaloga: I've got a shepherd's pie.


 Loading: I've got most of a stromboli.


 Babaloga: Oh, I didn't realize we were doing fractions. I've got like n-nine tenths of a shepherd's pie.


 Loading: Okay. [Reading from the screen of the movie] A Finnegan... A Finnegan-Pinchuk Picture.


 Babaloga: That - They're watching the movie too!


 Loading: Fred Savage is in this! 


 Babaloga: Th - the Wizard is in this?!


 Loading: The Wizard is in this!! Guys, they put the wizard in this one.


 Babaloga: It's wild that they put Fred Savage and the Wizard in the exact same font at the exact same size on screen.


 Loading: I agree. This billing is getting ridiculous.


 Babaloga: Sam McMurray. So many 'Mc's in this one. Do you ever notice that?


 Loading: Wendy Phillips is here? She's not a 'Mc'.


 Babaloga: Who's Wendy Phillips?


 Loading: I don't know.


 Babaloga: Well, then keep her name out of your goddamn mouth.


 Loading: That's true.


 Babaloga: I love it when, like, one person in the credits gets the character name as well.


 Loading: Mhm.


 Babaloga: Like, are - are they assuming that those are people we won't recognize or...


 Loading: Maybe! I don't know.


 Babaloga: So far this movie sucks. It's just a kid walking along the side of a road.


 Loading: Well, so, they used to front load the credits, which is what's happening.


 Babaloga: But like, not in the nineties.


 Loading: Yeah, in the nineties.


 Babaloga: No. They did other stuff under the credits in the nineties.


 Loading: They did it for Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed. Oh, Todd Holland is in this. That's Spider-Man.


 Babaloga: How dare you say this to me? Also, that was the director.


 Loading: Damn, Spider-Man directed this.


 Babaloga: Oh, is this that famous crop duster scene? From North by Northwest? I mean, from the Wizard?


 Loading: I haven't seen North by North - I mean The Wizard.


 Babaloga: Have you actually not seen North by Northwest?


 Loading: No I haven't.


 Babaloga: We're watching The Wizard.


 Loading: We're watching The Wizard.


 Babaloga: Can the kid not see these people? They're like, talking about him like he's not there. 


 Loading: Definitely no.


 Babaloga: Oh. No, we don't.


 Sorry. The guy - the guy said we all want to go to California.


 Loading: Well, they're watching the movie, Baba.                                    


 Babaloga: They're watching - you're all watching the movie, right? 


 Loading: Mhm. 
 
 Babaloga: I just like to repeat things that are said in movies.


 Loading: How windy is it only for this kid?


 Babaloga: That's the winds of change.


 Loading: Mhm. Is that a metaphorical or a literal wind of change?


 Babaloga: [Silence] What the hell is a metaphorical wind of change?


 Loading: Uh, so imagine a wind, but it's not actually there. But it does change.


 Babaloga: That sounds like nothing. You're describing nothing. Ah, fuck. They locked him in a cage made of blinds. Oh, fuck. They locked her in a cage made of blinds, too! 


 Loading: What's up with her yellow sailor suit?


 Babaloga: It is - it's a weird - it's a weird look. I wonder what branch - I guess if you're, uh, engineering in the Navy, you get the yellow suit. Maybe engineering or operations. This episode is gonna suck so bad.


 Loading: This episode is gonna suck - well, they're all watching the movie. They're engrossed in the film.


 Babaloga: Yeah, they're engrossed in the - the great story of a kid who likes making blocks. It's wild that that's like... if you got to be worried about the kid. He builds structures out of blocks designed for that purpose.


 Loading: He's building monuments to man's folly, he says. This is all - ashes to ashes, dust to dust, and he builds things with blocks.


 Babaloga: If you think about it, every monument is to man's folly.


 Loading: No shit Sherlock.


 Babaloga: Stop thinking about it. Don't think about it that much. Just a little bit. Just enough. Who the fuck is this guy? I looked away for one second and we're in a whole different scene? How is that allowed?


 Loading: It's the magic of editing.


 Babaloga: Why is that guy look familiar?


 Loading: I don't know, I didn't read any of the credits.


 Babaloga: You know what, he looks like Wilson from House, a little bit.


 Loading: You know, he does look like Wilson from House. Why are we watching House?


 Babaloga: That - you - ah - Loading you, like, pressured me into watching this movie. You can't ask me why we're not watching something else.


 Loading: I want to give you an out where you said "Maybe we should watch House:, and we watch an episode of House instead of this.


 Babaloga: I mean, at this point, an episode of House would be about as long.


 Loading: That's true.


 Babaloga: And probably not as much fun, 'cause that show has bad things about it. But it's not... overall... bad enough to be funny.


 Loading: Are they putting Jimmy in a home?


 Babaloga: Who the fuck is Jimmy?


 Loading: I think he's the kid who was building with the blocks.


 Babaloga: Also, am I an idiot, or was that kid acting pretty good?


 Loading: That kid was acting with his entire body. That was a full body performance.


 Babaloga: I also though, like, don't spend a lot of time around kids, so I don't know if that kid was acting like a kid, but I believed it. You know?


 Loading: Baba, why don't we ever go back to the Dairy Queen and kick back a couple?


 Babaloga: Kick back a couple what?


 Loading: Kick back a - you know, a few blizzards...


 Babaloga: A couple vanilla ice cream cones.


 Loading: Yeah. Get a dilly bar.


 Babaloga: Imagine finishing a Dairy Queen blizzard and being like, yeah, I could go for one more Dairy Queen blizzard. Like, no.


 Loading: [Fancy accent] Garcon! Another Dairy Queen blizzard.


 Babaloga: My compliments to the chef.


 Loading: [Fancy affect] There you go. I like how they turned it upside down. It did not fall out.


 Babaloga: [Fancy accent] Dinner and a show.


 Loading: [Fancy accent] Much like those hibachis, but on my own budget.


 Babaloga: Yeah, why waste - why waste your money at an expensive hibachi place when you could instead go to Dairy Queen?


 Loading: Go to Dairy - flip it upside down.


 Babaloga: And just eat a meal's worth of ice cream.


 Loading: They're gonna put Jimmy in a home.


 Babaloga: This kid's gonna be pissed if he doesn't hit one of the coasts. 


 Loading: Yeah.


 Loading: Got it.


 Babaloga: Mhm.


 Loading: Incredible.


 Babaloga: The cultural obsession with California at this period of time is like... buck fucking wild to me.


 Loading: Mhm. How do you feel about that kid's skateboard?


 Babaloga: Um... gr- he's in Utah.


 Loading: Yeah.


 Babaloga: Green river, Utah....


 Loading: Could you not tell -


 Babaloga: And he's going skateboard to California?
 
 Loading: Could you not tell the autistic kid from the beginning was Mormon?


 Babaloga: Um, I don't know that you can identify Mormons on sight.


 Loading: YOU can't.


 Babaloga: I think that's, um, confirmation bias.


 Loading: No, you actually kinda - Mormon face is like a thing. Oh, my God, this is a retirement home for children.


 Babaloga: That is weird. Like what? What's going on here? Why is this kid look kind of like Shia LaBeouf?


 Loading: Well, that's his, like, evolution. Like Pokemon.


 Babaloga: The demon on my shoulder trying to get me to cheat at basketball.


 Loading: Oh, no, this whole film's gonna be bad about disabled - about not disabled people - about autistic people.


 Babaloga: Hm. I can't imagine the movie from the nineties being weird about disability.


 Loading: No.


 Babaloga: This movie's from the eighties though.


 Loading: This is - this is from the eighties. Yeah. So it's fair game.


 Babaloga: I did forget it's from the eighties. The opening credits make a little more sense now. 


 Loading: Yeah. 


 Babaloga: I think by the nineties, we were pretty much done with that.


 Loading: Um.


 Babaloga: Because I know Jurassic Park didn't do that shit. I don't think.


 Loading: What do you think of this song? 


 Babaloga: [Laughing] I feel like the fucking - the pan pipes over the shot of a hostess truck crossing a massive desert.


 Loading: That's Utah baby.


 Babaloga: The mystical quest begins.


 Loading: He's not handicapped. We just put him in a retirement home for kids.


 Babaloga: He's not handicapped. He plays golf better than any of us.


 Loading: He builds the blocks, you know.


 Babaloga: To eat their way across Utah.


 Loading: Are they going to shock this kid?


 Babaloga: Whoa, dude ina  bolo tie.


 Loading: Dude in bolo tie. There's a three alarm fire right there.


 Babaloga: Cory in the house!


 Loading: Was anybody like this, or is this movie just bad about children?


 Babaloga: Yeah, I don't know. I can't speak on that. But I do want to say, if anybody made it this far into this podcast episode without watching the movie along with us, um, uh, congratulations. I have the utmost respect for you and what you do, which is apparently sit through bad and boring things.


 Loading: I miss the pan pipes.


 Babaloga: You know, we could probably get away with including the audio. Like we're not distributing this widely. I'm literally just hosting the file on a - on a GitHub sites page. So, like.


 Loading: The audio is like, wicked quiet. I've got my audio blasted on my computer right now.


 Babaloga: Yeah, but like, we have an editor.


 Loading: That's true. The editor refused to be in the call, by the way.


 Babaloga: Yeah. Hass at outright flatly refused to watch this movie. And I did the same. But Loading begged and pleaded and sobbed... and shat...


 Loading: I didn't have a better idea. My vision for this podcast is each - each episode is a different structure. So we're gonna have to do a film commentary, one.


 Babaloga: We can't do meta planning for this podcast while we're in the podcast.


 Loading: We can actually.


 Babaloga: These are conversations that we must have off the air. We can't break Kayfabe. Kayfabe. Kayfabe.
   [Pronounced K-Fab, K-Faybe, Cafeb respectively] 


 Loading: Okay, that's a future episode where we break kayfabe.
   [Pronounced Kaafib]


 Babaloga: Where we break coffee.


 Loading: Mhm. I can't wait for our fully scripted episode.


 Babaloga: You know, what we should do for one episode is - we record it normally, and then we send each other our audio and we'd overdub the other person.


 Loading: That's a terrible idea. And I'm here for it.


 Babaloga: Yeah, because it's like - you're saying all this shit that I would say you're calling yourself Babaloga, and I'm saying all the shit that you would say and calling myself Loading. And people are gonna be like, what the fuck? Yeah. Is that allowed? Like that Vine?


 Loading: We actually, I think we can do planning in this episode because no one's gonna listen this far.


 Babaloga: Yeah. That's true. Nobody is still here. If anybody is still here, DM me a goose emoji.


 Loading: If anyone's still here, DM me that you DM'ed Ba - uh. a snip of you DMing Baba a goose emoji.


 Babaloga: These kids almost got hit by a truck.


 Loading: These kids are gonna get hit by a truck.


 Babaloga: I can't believe they put children in danger to make this movie. This movie's not even good. I would be one hundred percent in support of putting children in real mortal danger in order to make a good movie. But this is not.


 Loading: Oh, this is like that scene in Dead Poets Society where the guy takes out the porno mag.


 Babaloga: The Taylor Swift album?


 Loading: No, the film. With Robin Williams, where they stand on desks and it's really pretentious.


 Babaloga: [Eating noises] Taylor Swift album.


 Loading: I feel like Jimmy's got no autonomy.


 Babaloga: I can't imagine why that would be in this movie. Come'on.


 Loading: Play!


 Babaloga: Breaking news. Tri confirms that he likes this movie.


 Loading: Tri likes this movie?


 Babaloga: Apparently.


 Babaloga: There's a child on screen acting very much like they're supposed to be perceived as an adult.


 Loading: I think that's half this movie.


 Babaloga: It's a little bit like the scene in Detective Pikachu when, like, the what's her face? The female lead shows up and starts doing like... a weirdly sloppy recitation of like, a quick witted reporter thing from a noir novel. 


 Loading: Mhm. 


 Babaloga: And it's like, are we supposed to... like, is this is this being played sincerely? I genuinely can't tell.


 Loading: I think we need to treat every character in this game as if they're twenty years older than they are.


 Babaloga: [More eating sounds] Weird.


 Loading: Every character in this movie. 


 Loading: I love those cardboard cutout of a man with the sign.


 Babaloga: Yeah, he's got a great mustache. Wow, what a fucked up thing to say.


 Loading: Oh, shit. He's good at double dragon.


 Babaloga: Double dragon deez nuts across your face. 


 Loading: Goddamit. 


 Babaloga: God, I'm sorry.


 Loading: Baba, I thought we were gonna be polite this episode.


 Babaloga: Why? Why would you think that?


 Loading: Because misery needs company.


 Babaloga: I'm here under duress. Send - if anyone's listening to this, send help!


 Loading: If anyone's listening to this, you can ask me for help.


 Babaloga: Oh, the music got very eighties. It's like knockoff labyrinth.


 Loading: Baba, can we play the original Double Dragon next episode?


 Babaloga: I would honestly rather forget that this movie and everything associated with it even exists. Why is she so much taller than them in this scene? She was the same height in the last scene.


 Loading: She was taller than them in the last scene. You're too distracted by saying "double dragon deez nuts across your face".


 Babaloga: No, they were! They were the same height last scene.


 Loading: They were not.


 Babaloga: I remember it was notable because it was like... she seemed like she would be taller than them. But you're probably right. There's no way that movies would adjust the heights of their actors shot to shot in order to make the shot. No, that's a ridiculous conspiracy theory.


 Loading: Yeah, it's fucking dumb.


 Babaloga: How do they know that the kids got away in the hostess truck?


 Loading: I don't know. This is a plothole in the film The Wizard. God, that's a truck.


 Babaloga: Aw, I wish they died.


 Loading: Oh, shit. Ninja Gaiden?


 Babaloga: I didn't know anybody knew about that game.


 Loading: No, no, I didn't know anyone was good at that game.


 Babaloga: Wait. What the - Where are they?


 Loading: They're in a diner.


 Babaloga: It's a diner with a TV embedded in the middle of the table.


 Loading: A TV with Ninja Gaiden. California.


 Babaloga: California. It's funny because like, a home is short - generally short for, like, an old folks home. But in this context - I love how he's still playing uninterrupted with a magazine completely covering the screen, also - in this context, though, it does sound like it's like you believe that Jimmy doesn't deserve to be in a home. It's like, wow, fucked up. Jimmy doesn't deserve shelter.


 Loading: Jimmy doesn't deserve a stable lifestyle. We split the money.


 Babaloga: I can't believe this is the original girl boss.


 Loading: This guy?


 Babaloga: No. This guy. This guy in the bolo tie is the original girl boss! Turns out anything women can do, men can do better.


 Loading: This guy had the fucking Seinfeld ass intro theme.


 Babaloga: He does, yeah. Oh, wow. They really skeedaddled. 


 Loading: He really does look like tall George Costanza.


 Babaloga: Also, did you see the Pepsi logo in the background? The old one from before they - they redesigned it to incorporate the magnetic field and gravitational attraction of Pepsi?


 Loading: You made that up.


 Babaloga: Wait, do you really not know about this?


 Loading: I don't know about - Oh, my God, he just bought a knife on someone - 


 Babaloga: A balding guy with a bolo tie is poppin' the tires on your truck with a knife. Can't have shit in Utah. Roll up your window, guy.


 Loading: Dude, you slashed his fucking tires!


 Babaloga: What I want to know is why he didn't leave sooner.


 Loading: Was a shit throw.


 Babaloga: So far, the music in this movie is, um, really bad.


 Loading: It's - every single music track in this film is a choice so far.


 Babaloga: Every single music track in this film feels like it's royalty free.


 Loading: It does.


 Babaloga: I love those trucks! The ones with the big round snoots.


 Loading: Oh, yeah.


 Babaloga: Look. And they got cows inside to match.


 Loading: Right now he's singing about the cow level in Diablo.


 Babaloga: You gotta be very adult to live in Reno. It's the world's biggest little city.


 Loading: Great legs. That was what I always said about my mom when I was eight years old. I said, you know, she had great legs.


 Babaloga: It's like fucked up because, you know, that she's just, like, repeating the things that she's heard her dad say.


 Loading: Mm.


 Babaloga: Which I guess is not that fucked up, but still. Yeah. Listen, I don't care if they're stowaways. You don't just grab a kid like that. But I guess it was the eighties. You could grab whoever. What's the situation with these truckers. So they're like, so desperate for fifteen dollars in singles that they'll assault three kids for?


 Loading: Just, like, real life.


 Babaloga: Like, wow, I guess the cow trucking business isn't what it used to be. That game looks stupid.


 Loading: That game sucks shit.


 Babaloga: Who wants to play as a middle aged plumber? That's fucked up. Hey, wait. I've been there.


 Loading: It's a nice.


 Babaloga: Hang on. I gotta find out where they actually are. Because I'm - Because I've been somewhere very, very much like. There.


 Loading: That's his shorts cash! 
 
 Babaloga: Eat my shorts.


 Babaloga: Four bucks will get you a house and a... suitcase full of cocaine in this town.


 Loading: Did you say four bucks will get you a suitcase full of cocaine?


 Babaloga: I said a house and a suitcase full of cocaine in this town.


 Loading: Is it a Tom Petty poster?


 Babaloga: I don't know who that is or what a poster is.


 Loading: You couldn't tell in real time that Baba's actually really bad at me. Go on.


 Babaloga: I guess I'll take their word for it that he's smiling. He's two or three pixels-ing from where I'm sitting.


 Loading: This was shot on film. You can really tell. I had one of those slingshots. Why do you have that?


 Babaloga: What is that?


 Loading: That was - that was a really cheap sound effect of a man getting punched.


 Babaloga: No, no, no. You were like, why do you have that? And I was reading Mechscord.


 Loading: Oh, no. He had, like, a rubber Halloween mask on him.


 Babaloga: Wow.


 Loading: I'm like, why do you have that? Oh, shit. Are you enjoying this music track?


 Babaloga: No... I'm enjoying the footage of sheep, though.


 Loading: You are a known sheep enjoyer. 


 Babaloga: Eat!


 Loading: Eat!


 Babaloga: Eat!


 Loading: Skateboard!


 Babaloga: Imagine you were Ella Enchanted and you saw a sign that just said eat. And you had to eat whatever was in your hands at that moment. Would that be fucked up or what? Anyway, I'm Rod Sterling.


 Loading: Imagine Ella Enchanted. 


 Babaloga: No. 
 
 Loading: Do not tell that man about where the children are.


 Babaloga: Yeah. If a guy in a bolo tie comes up to you and goes, "Hey, Pops, have you seen these kids?", don't answer him. Also, I like that we hear him call the guy "Pops", but we don't see the guy who was talking to. Absolutely wild that that scene didn't resolve with the kid's parents showing up.


 Loading: It was the eighties. It was the worst time.


 Babaloga: But, like, that's, that's the most incompetently executed comedic beat I've ever seen.


 Loading: Okay. What did you think of that Volkswagen bug with spider legs? 


 Babaloga: Yeah, the VW spider was rad. So far highlighted of the movie. 


 Loading: Highlight of the film.


 Babaloga: But like that. Like the - the comedic beat there, right? Ferris Bueller did a very similar thing, but they actually executed it right. You see someone from behind who looks like the person you're chasing down, you go up, you're like, ah, I got you now. Turns out not to be them. You get your ass handed to you.


 Loading: Yeah.


 Babaloga: And instead, in this one, instead of, like, the kid's parent showing up and being like, hey, did you just fucking touch my kid and kock- punching the guy. Instead, the kid's just like, that was weird. And the guy walks away like, what was the point of that scene? Nothing funny happened.


 Loading: Is that Daytona, USA?


 Babaloga: Plutonium USA.


 Loading: No. It's F1... dream.


 Babaloga: F1 dream.


 Loading: Oh, shit. They're playing Hangin' Tough.


 Babaloga: [To the tune of Queen’s “Radio Gaga”] All we do is video monsters.


 Loading: Lucas is awesome. I can't believe Tri told us this movie's good. Oh, fuck. Wait a minute.


 Babaloga: Rebecca Sugar is going to direct an animated feature film based on the Moomins for Annapurna.


 Loading: Interesting. Are you not watching The Wizard right now, Baba?


 Babaloga: Loading. I have not once been watching The Wizard.


 Loading: You called out the VW bug with spider - Oh, shit. It's here, Baba! The reason we're watching the movie!


 Babaloga: It's so bad. 


 Loading: This is it. This is why we're here.


 Babaloga: Oh, shit. Hollywood squares. What the fuck is that thing? 


 Loading: What is it? 


 Babaloga: So, have they made it to California?


 Loading: No. It looks bad to use in the game.


 Babaloga: It's so funny that he's clearly not doing the motions that map to the screen.


 Loading: No, I think he's got an invisible steering wheel is what's happening right now.


 Babaloga: No, that's, that's the idea. But he moved his hand the same way twice, and the car moved two different directions. Try doing that with a D-pad. It's so bad. What the fuck? Hey, what the fuck?


 Loading: Hey, bud. Even Jimmy's like, yeah. I'm like, hey, bud, what the fuck?


 Babaloga: Hey, man, that's like, you just did a thing that's super not okay. Okay. Yeah. Jimmy's walking out.


 Loading: We stan Jimmy. What did he just say about keeping your power gloves off her?


 Babaloga: Well, he grabbed her with his non-power glove hand, so.


 Loading: Okay, that's acceptable, I guess. It's still not great.


 Babaloga: In the - in the overall ranking of only paying attention to the desires of the men and boys in the movie. I think we're still on track.


 Loading: Okay, that's the important part, I think.


 Babaloga: All right. I have great news for anyone who's still listening somehow. Um, we are only about an hour away from the end of this movie.


 Loading: We're approaching the halfway point.


 Babaloga: Sort of. Will be - the halfway point would be fifty minutes. We're at thirty eight minutes. I feel like maybe to release this episode, we should have a regular movie cut and then a cut that is like, all of the silences removed so that you can listen to it as a weird podcast that doesn't make any sense.


 Loading: I disagree, I think we should keep in the weird silences so that people forget they're listening to a weird podcast that doesn't make any sense.


 Babaloga: If people want to do that, they can listen to the movie cut without watching the movie.


 Loading: It's up to Hass.


 Babaloga: If you're listening to the movie cut without watching the movie, uh, DM me the dove emoji.


 Loading: Also ping me.


 [Hacceuee's note - if you listened to neither and just read the transcript, DM Baba the bee emoji please]


 Babaloga: This is the kind of shit that we have to resort to, because there's no way to actually track listens on... when you're just hosting a.


 Loading: We don't know if you like this. If you like this, DM me a fire emoji.


 Babaloga: If you - if you hate this so much you didn't even get this far, DM me a lightning bolt emoji. Keep in mind though, I will know that you're lying. That is a fucked up situation to be in. I'll give you that.


 Loading: It is pretty bad.


 Babaloga: Sleeping with your father in some dump on the highway.


 Loading: Mhm. It's a bad spot to be in.


 Babaloga: That's a double bed. Oh, double beds, like two beds. It's confusing because a double bed is a thing. And you were literally just on this movie is. It's a real relic.


 Loading: It really is.


 Babaloga: It's not a tie in to any of the properties. It's a tie in to the console itself.


 Loading: It is a tie in to one of the properties later. This is the first - spoiler for the film The Wizard, the only thing I know about it - is this is the first time they ever show - 


 Babaloga: It's - they premiered Super Mario World here. 


 Loading: This is the first time they ever show Super Mario Brothers 3.


 Babaloga: ...Brothers 3. Okay. They were playing it earlier on screen.


 Loading: No, they were playing 1 on screen, I think.


 Babaloga: That was not 1.


 Loading: Was it? It might be World. One of them was it. 


 Babaloga: They were not playing Super Mario Bros 1.


 Loading: Well.


 Babaloga: Mega turtle. I don't know if is what that joke was. But I do like the joke of like a guy getting really into an 8-bit game and not knowing what anything is called, and so just coming up with his own names for everything.


 Loading: That's good.


 Babaloga: And so he's like, I got the scroll weapon and I almost beat Mega Turtle at the end of level three. And it's like, dude, what the fuck are you talking about? 


 Loading: What are you on about?


 Babalaga: Wow, I can't believe this drive in was deserted even in the eighties.
 
 Babaloga: Whoa!


 Loading: No more books. 


 Babaloga: Hey! Why is he so mean? If I remember correctly, this - this movie has sort of a reverse Dumbo ending where it's like, no, you did need the feather to fly, actually. You're lucky you have that feather because you're nothing without it. I haven't actually seen this movie, I just...


 Loading: No, you know it in your heart.


 Babaloga: I know of it. I know some stuff about it.


 Babaloga: Jeez, Cory. Jeez.


 Loading: You're so thick. Don't you see? You're all he's got.


 Babaloga: God damn! Cory!


 Loading: Jesus Christ, Cory, you fucking imbecile!


 Babaloga: Damn! Cory, where are you going with all that cake?


 Loading: I - uh - Is that - Mm. Oh, no. It's them.


 Babaloga: I like that she has a literal carpet bag. That's - that's some nice visual - visual storytelling. I bet you can outrun a truck if you have enough whimsy.


 Loading: These kids have no whimsy, is the thing.


 Babaloga: You have to have a certain amount of whimsy to be wearing overall shorts.


 Loading: It's the eighties. I don't think you do.


 Babaloga: Ah. You're right.


 Loading: Know what's in there, though? Yeah. Ah, fuck. His hat. You get laced like that.


 Babaloga: I love the first guy to go "Thanks, kids" sounded sincere. Like it was - it was a slightly apologetic. "Thanks, kids." Like, "Listen, I know my friends are a lot. It's fucked up what's happening right here. And we are going to talk about it later. But for now, between us."


 Loading: Not to you, but.


 Babaloga: Yeah, like "If I - if I try to rock the boat now, they'll just retreat further into this violent behavior. I'm going to bring it up at a time when they'll be more receptive to it."


 Loading: I'm sorry, he had a twin sister?


 Babaloga: Who doesn't?


 Loading: Me! Do you have a twin sister?


 Babaloga: [Disengaged] No.


 Loading: Well.


 Babaloga: So I guess that's two, but... 


 Loading: That's two!


 Babaloga: ...probably everyone else does.


 Loading: Yeah. Sample sizing of a gnat.


 Babaloga: Yeah.


 Loading: I know Pep's got a twin. I don't know if it's a sister, but.


 Babaloga: It's got a twin. You mean there's two Peps running around?


 Loading: I think there's a - I think there's a - I think PEPs got a twin. I'm like... seventy percent on that.


 Babaloga: We got a pep, pep and a tallyho.


 Loading: There's Pep Boy and Pep Bro


 Babaloga: or Pep-sis.


 Both: Pepsis.


 Loading: Is that what you get Pepboy in your blood? 


 Babaloga: Yeah. We gotta act fast. He's already peptic or Pep-sib, but that's not as fun to say.


 Loading: I mean, he's Pepgrad now. It's fine. We'll have to ask Pep about his brother some other time when we're not watching the Wizard.


 Babaloga: Okay, so you do know that it's not a twin sister?


 Loading: That's true. Unless they're trans, we don't know.


 Babaloga: If Pep refers to them as - as his brother...


 Loading: You know what? That's true.


 Babaloga: They're probably his brother. Whether or not they're trans, whether or not he's trans, presumably. We know extremely nothing about this person, though.


 Loading: So which person? Pep's brother? Yeah.


 Babaloga: Whoa! Exact halfway point in the movie the - the kid talks.


 Loading: This is certainly a song choice.


 Babaloga: What song is this?


 Loading: [Singing] Nowhere to hide. Nowhere to hide.


 Babaloga: Oh!


 Loading: Listen up, fruit fly. It's time to get real.


 Babaloga: It is funny how, like, steeped in the arcade culture this movie is. Like, it's just understood that, like, like, the audience will know that if you jostle a machine like that, you ruin the person's game because the anti-cheat detection will kick.


 Loading: Mhm. And it like it assumes that you know that, like Double Dragon and Ninja Gaiden are brutally difficult games.


 Babaloga: Yeah. Modern day remake of that movie, um, he's like playing Silksong and they're like, holy shit, he beat Moss Mother first try.


 Loading: He beat - He He beat First Chorus in under eleven attempts or - Fourth Chorus. For the people at home, it took Baba eleven attempts to beat Fourth Chorus.


 Babaloga: I actually don't have a number of how many attempts it took me to beat Fourth Chorus. You just came up with eleven.


 Loading: I believe, I believe it was eleven.


 Babaloga: Why would you - You were not there for it. Why would you believe anything?


 Loading: I was there for it.


 Babaloga: You weren't. 


 Loading: I was!


 Babaloga: You genuinely straight up weren't. I beat it before you ever played it.


 Loading: I'm pretty sure I was in the call when you fought Fourth Chorus.


 Babaloga: I'm like, ninety nine percent sure you weren't. You've been in the call for me, fighting plenty of other bosses, but I'm pretty sure it was just me and Hass when I was fighting Fourth Chorus.


 Loading: I'm pretty sure I was there, 'cause I fought it the same night.


 Babaloga: No, that's definitely untrue, because I remember when you got to it and it was like two days later.


 Loading: Eh, whatever. Oh, shit. It's Reno.


 Babaloga: Reno. Welcome to Fabulous Reno.


 Loading: So this is where you live. He's a trucker! His name is Spain. Upon my heartache!


 Babaloga: What are they playing? Craps.


 Loading: No idea. Do I look like a gambling man?


 Babaloga: Did she literally. just, like, completely luck out. She was like, hey, I'll give you a good tip on how to win at craps. Put it all on eight.


 Loading: What the fuck just happened?


 Babaloga: Oh, so she - I see. She's not allowed to bet because she's not old enough. She's not old enough to gamble. So he's like her stand in.


 Loading: Yeah. I think we.


 Loading: Should bring back Nintendo Helpline..


 Babaloga: Which Castlevania is Simon's Quest. [Typing] 2! Okay, the bad one.


 Loading: And this kid's gonna get really good at it. Yo, what the fuck?


 Babaloga: I like that their only concern in terms of money is how they're gonna pay for the arcade machines, and not how they're going to pay for food or lodging. The dialogue under the music is always so much funnier than the actual dialogue.


 Loading: It's really good.


 Babaloga: Okay, Rick! Can you say that one more time?


 Loading: Taking out a binder: "Uh, watch out for the fireballs". "Oh, I didn't I didn't know that was a thing I had to look out for, you know."


 Babaloga: I just love how, like, weirdly naturalistic it is. She's like, "Al right. I didn't quite get that one right. Can you say that again?" when, like, every other line that she said in this movie has been straight out of an 80s kid's movie. Metroid! I know that one! This kid's covering the whole Metroidvania gambit - gam - ga - gamut. I got there.


 Loading: Oh! Contra.


 Babaloga: What the fuck is that? That's Mario 2. Okay, it might have been Mario 2 that we saw before.


 Loading: I think it was.


 Babaloga: Or Super Mario USA, if you will.


 Loading: What is this kid gonna play Street Fighter? Okay, that's also Contra.


 Babaloga: Is Street Fighter out?


 Loading: Uh, Street Fighter one would have been out. I don't know about - I think 2 also would have been out.


 Babaloga: Street fighter 2 was the first one that was really big, though, right?


 Loading: Street fighter 2 - Street fighter 1 is weird. Street fighter 2 is like the foundation for all fighting games to this day.


 Babaloga: Yeah. So probably if - if 2 isn't out yet, it's probably not in this movie.


 Loading: It's a lot of money. The hat. Do you think it's a good hat? Baba?


 Babaloga: What's going on?


 Loading: What do you think about the hat?


 Babaloga: I got distracted reading Yuri.


 Loading: What Yuri?


 Babaloga: Oh, no. I'm just reading the - the fucking Shen Comics tumblr page. So there is Yuri here.


 Loading: Oh yeah. There is Yuri here.


 Babaloga: It's not Yuri forward experience. 


 Loading: No. 


 Babaloga. Well, I guess it is. But.


 Loading: But it depends on where in Shen comics you are. Yeah.


 Babaloga: Win ten thousand dollars! So you had a hat related question?


 Loading: Yeah. What do you think of the hat - the green hat he's worth.


 Babaloga: Well, it's a green hat, Loading. I don't know what you want from me.


 Loading: Well, you - there was a better shot of it.


 Babaloga: The car is getting towed, Loading. And all you can talk about is their a hat.


 Loading: Or, like, the car's getting toes, am I right? I don't know what that means. Someone out there will. If you know what that means, 
@Babalola, tell him what it means.


 Babaloga: Yeah, he's got the fucking glasses. Why can't I remember the name of the guy those glasses are named after? ...Marx. Karl Marx glasses. 


 Loading: Groucho!


 Babaloga: Groucho! Oscar the Groucho glasses.


 Loading: Oscar the Groucho glasses. So you can put them in your soup or your friends soup. You could do anything with these. Why was that scene in the movie? You ever been to Reno?


 Babaloga: Um, no. Which is weird, because I've been, like, everywhere around Reno. 


 Loading: Yeah, same. 


 Babaloga: I've been to Salt Lake, I've been to Phoenix, I've been to Albuquerque and Roswell and Las Vegas and San Francisco and San Diego. I've never been to LA, though.


 Loading: We should go to Reno.


 Babaloga: Why would I go to Reno?


 Loading: So we can go to Reno, like in the movie The Wizard.


 Babaloga: If I was going to go somewhere now, it would be somewhere with a Meow Wolf location like Las Vegas or Grapevine, Texas, which I believe is actually Houston.


 Loading: You wanna go to Las Vegas together?


 Babaloga: I will admit that would be kind of funny.


 Loading: It'd be kind of funny if we went to Las Vegas.


 Babaloga: I don't have the time or the money to do that, but if I do, maybe. Just because it would be really funny.


 Loading: It's supposed to be really cheap to get out there right now.


 Babaloga: We would have to record an episode of the podcast even if we're no longer doing this by the time that happens.


 Loading: Correct, yeah. I also don't have PTO or money currently. I also don't have a ton of interest in being in Vegas.


 Babaloga: What's going on?


 Loading: I don't have a ton of interest in the things you do in Vegas.


 Babaloga: Vegas - the interesting thing about Vegas is... its mere existence. Like you got to see it once. What the fuck was that shot? Hey, guys.


 Loading: Hey, guys. No, it's the old man in the speedo there.


 Babaloga: Uh, you know what? I'm down for some equality. Um.


 Loading: An ass for an ass, you know.


 Babaloga: Uh, like, it's. It's just like it's wild. Like it's a wild thing. You get, like, entire indoor fucking rivers.


 Loading: What's he playing? We should go to Vegas. We'll do a live show out in Vegas. I think a live episode of the podcast.


 Babaloga: A live show from our hotel room. Like. Yeah, if anyone actually wants to show up, here's - here's our hotel room.


 Loading: No, don't like this. Don't like this. Mhm, don't like that. Don't like anything that just happened there.


 Babaloga: I'm glad I wasn't paying attention then.


 Loading: I don't want to talk about it, but it sucked.


 Babaloga: [Mouth full] I don't want you to. I wasn't paying attention.


 Loading: We'll have to rewind the film, then.


 Babaloga: Oh, wait, that's a really familiar sound effect. What is that?


 Loading: Is that Takeshi's challenge?


 Babaloga: It is. That never released on NES. I don't know what the fuck this guy was playing.


 Loading: Was that Takeshi's challenge?


 Babaloga: I think that's where the noise was from.


 Loading: I think that's what that shot of the screen was. 


 Babaloga: Yeah I think that was Takeshi's challenge. 


 Loading: That was that very distinct, boring building shape.


 Babaloga: Yeah. Well, and the, the [makes a sound effect].


 Loading: Yeah.


 Babaloga: That's why it was so familiar. I actually just played it for, for class.


 Loading: How was it?


 Babaloga: A week ago. Bad. Obviously. It's Takeshi's challenge. It's not a good game.


 Loading: So what game - good games have you played lately, Baba?


 Babaloga: Um, that's a really complicated question, Loading. Because what is good? What is game?


 Loading: The last game I remember knowing that you played was - well I mean Takeshi's challenge - before that How Fish Is Made, which is a very interesting game.


 Babaloga: Yeah, I don't know. Let me open my Steam up. I've mostly been playing games I've been making.


 Loading: Mm! In RPG maker.


 Babaloga: Let's see. Sort by... last played Tabletop Simulator. I accidentally launched Return of the Obra Dinn... Uh. Haste, Silksong, How Fish Is Made, the Abbey of Crime. Extensum. Umurangi generation. Beat Saber. Sword of the Sea. Peak.


 Loading: Nice.


 Babaloga: ...are my last ten played games.


 Loading: If you want to play Peak, ping me.


 Babaloga: Last time I played Peak was August seventeenth.


 Loading: You should play Peak again.


 Babaloga: I play Peak again sometime. That'll be our next episode. Let's Play of Peak.


 Loading: Some of the, um. Some of the Tacos have been getting into Peak lately and I'm like, you're a bit late, but I think I can do a mega server with the Mechs.


 Babaloga: Damn. That's crazy.


 Loading: Damn. That's crazy.


 Babaloga: Why are they sitting in front of a matte painting?


 Loading: If there was a matte painting set up like that, I would sit in front of it.


 Babaloga: That's true. I guess you're right.


 Loading: We need more matte paintings in real life. Only thirty four minutes left. Baba. Jimmy? Did he - was he always missing teeth?


 Babaloga: I don't know, probably. He's a kid. They don't got no teeth.


 Loading: That kid's got all his teeth. Not even Lucas. And he had the Nintendo Power Glove.


 Babaloga: Not even Lucas.


 Loading: Not even Lucas from... mother three. What does that mean?


 Babaloga: Uh, I don't know. I, I truly - the extent to which I've checked out of this movie cannot be fathomed.


 Loading: That's a shame, because there's... over thirty minutes left.


 Babaloga: Yeah, just over. Just barely over.


 Loading: Baba, I need you to lock in.


 Babaloga: It's not gonna happen.


 Loading: I'm locked in.


 Babaloga: I believe that. Oh, my God, this guy's gonna get pancaked by four trucks. I love that for him.


 Loading: Not four trucks!


 Babaloga: [Singing] Four trucks having sex. Four trucks having sex. 


 Loading: [Singing] Four trucks... Having sex.


 Babaloga: [Singing] My muscles. My muscles involuntarily flex.


 Loading: I wish I had a 7-Eleven Slurpee.


 Babaloga: This guy sucks at drinking Slurpees. They go in your mouth, idiot. Not on your eyes.


 Loading: I'm sorry. He stole that rag.


 Babaloga: That's based.


 Loading: Oh, shit. It's video Armageddon.


 Babaloga: Video. Armageddon. Damn. I mean, I know that video killed the radio star, but what's killing all the video? Hass, uh cut that.


 Loading: Hass, keep it in. Double it.


 Babaloga: There is absolutely no way he's listening to this. I could say all kinds of shit. [They start lying] Hass loves [redacted].


 Loading: Hass is a huge [redacted]. Haas is actually [redacted].


 Babaloga: Hass is a [redacted] and uh, one of the designers of [redacted].


 Loading: In total, I believe Hass has [redacted].


 Babaloga: Yeah, and gotten over [redacted] which is kind of remarkable.


 Loading: It's kind of insane. She's big into [redacted], too. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One.


 Babaloga: You're a couple seconds ahead of me, and I don't even know how that's possible.


 Babaloga: That's Thirteen Squared.


 Loading: Is that a thing that happened?


 Babaloga: Uh, I stopped paying attention again. What?


 Loading: [Tired] Oh my God.


 Babaloga: What happened? I like this guy's red button on his tie. He looks like Hal 9000.


 Loading: It's really good. I think it's a metaphor.


 Babaloga: I like - I like how she's dressed as the Joker. And the two of them are wearing identical blue shirts.


 Loading: Are you sober right now, Babaloga?


 Babaloga: Do you have to ask me that question?


 Loading: [Laughing] No, but I think it's good for the listener to know.


 Babaloga: I did make a promise to you before we started recording.


 Loading: You did.


 Babaloga: Whoa. That guy's fucking schpinnin'.


 Loading: This is actually the music from Ninja Gaiden.


 Babaloga: Ninja guy?


 Loading: Yep, that's Ninja Gaiden. All right.


 Babaloga: Ninja guy. I like this guy in the hat. I also really like that clock.


 Loading: It's a really good clock.


 Babaloga: I love, I love, um, digital readout clocks that are actually mechanical.


 Loading: It's really good.


 Babaloga: What the fuck? The kid's number is four, two, seven?!


 Loading: Is that a reference?


 Babaloga: Is - is - is Stanley - is Stanley's employee number a reference to The Wizard? 'Cause I will fucking jump off a building.


 Loading: I think if you asked, what's his face? Uh, Davy, uh, the whoever wrote -


 Babaloga: Davy Redden.


 Loading: I think if you ask him that directly, he would say it's whatever you want it to be.


 Babaloga: No he wouldn't.


 Loading: No.


 Babaloga: I've seen the man speak about his own game. He would be like, f- no.


 Loading: Oh, shit. He's getting out the Power Glove.


 Babaloga: What the fuck is this set?


 Loading: "Children. Siblings. Animals." Maybe that's how we open our next episode.


 Babaloga: You know what.


 Loading: "Ladies. Gentlemen. Children. Siblings. Animalllls."  


 Babaloga: I have no control over how we open the episodes. I couldn't - I couldn't do something different if I wanted to.


 Loading: You could ask. 


 Babaloga: You could have tried in the past.


 Loading: You tried once. We're like three episodes in. There's a new game, Baba.


 Babaloga: There's - nobody has made any new games. What the fuck? That's The Good Place. That's literally the set that they used for the neighborhood in The Good Place.


 Loading: Oh, my God, you're right. Is the Good place a reference to the wizard? I like him going "Excuse my language". Like, I just, like, shrugs, like. Yeah. No fair. Oh.


 Babaloga: Shit.


 Loading: Oh, shit. Dork lips.


 Babaloga: Dork lips.


 Loading: I don't think you gotta run at this point. Is this the Universal Studios tram tour?


 Babaloga: Yeah, probably. What else would it be? Some other tram tour? Yeah, right. As if!


 Loading: That would make sense why all the - all the Universal Monsters - right. This is a universal picture. 


 Babaloga: Is it? I guess the - What? Is that real?


 Loading: Is it? 


 Babaloga: I don't fucking know.


 Loading: Look it up.


 Babaloga: The only movie I know of with Monte Carlo in the title is Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo, which is a cinematic masterpiece, an underrated gem, a diamond in the rough.


 Loading: Is it?


 Babaloga: Yeah. Have you not seen it?


 Loading: Next episode, we're gonna - you're gonna rank all the Herbie movies.


 Babaloga: I'm absolutely down to do that.


 Loading: Okay.


 Babaloga: I'm not gonna rewatch any of them in anticipation of that episode.


 Loading: Okay, good. You guys don't know this: Babaloga's a Herbie sicko. Oh, shit. Animatronic King Kong.


 Babaloga: That's scary. I'm also - I also am get scared of robots when I see them.


 Loading: I wish I was a big animatronic gorilla. How do you know that? You don't - do you have a watch, kid?


 Babaloga: I have a watch. Oh, you're talking to the character on the screen, that - Loading, are you sober? They can't hear you.


 Loading: I am sober. I don't do drug and alcohol. Unlike some people here.


 Babaloga: I do all - I do so much...


 Loading: List off all the drugs you do regularly. 


 Babaloga: I was gonna say I do so much drug and some alcohol, but neither of those things are... I guess some alcohol is true, but I do some drug, and some alcohol is not as funny.


 Loading: What joke are you currently do?


 Babaloga: The drug I'm currently on is just alcohol actually. I decided not to get crossfaded for this.


 Loading: That makes sense. That makes sense. 


 Babaloga: I mean, decided is one thing. It's also just that - that it's - it's across the room.


 Loading: What?


 Babaloga: The drug is across the room. So it's sort of... that's mostly what's going on.


 Loading: How do you feel about Lucas's hair? No, don't like that.


 Babaloga: That is weird. 


 Loading: No, bud, don't.


 Babaloga: Don't touch people's hair.


 Loading: Don't touch people. 


 Babaloga: Don't touch people's hair.


 Loading: Don't touch - don't touch minors.


 Babaloga: Well, yeah. I mean, like, it's, you know, like a reassuring pat on the back or whatever, but, like, - 


 Loading: If a Kid's on the ground, you can help them get up. 


 Babaloga: - if you're grabbing - if you're grabbing people's hair, that's weird.


 Loading: I think a reassuring pat on the back I  do - I would never give to a minor.


 Babaloga: This man's literally never seen an elevator before. I do like when the adult character who's constantly, like out - outmaneuvered by young children in these movies ends up having like a full blown mental breakdown over it, because I think that's where I would end up.


 Loading: Like in Big Fat Liar.


 Babaloga: Yeah, or the, the guy in Ferris Bueller.


 Loading: Mm. You should watch Big Fat Liar after this.


 Babaloga: I've seen it.


 Loading: You could rewatch it.


 Babaloga: Why would I do that?


 Loading: So we can record another podcast episode. Why'd that kid get a better entrance?


 Babaloga: Because they know he's the protagonist.


 Loading: Give it up for 3!


 Babaloga: I love that you can tell the footage is superimposed. That's really funny.


 Loading: They probably were only given the footage from Nintendo. 


 Babaloga: Yeah.


 Babaloga: Also, I love that they're like, uh, the world premiere of the game is where they're doing this competition. Like, what the fuck? Does this make any sense?


 Loading: I love that this makes no sense. What?


 Babaloga: How do you know where that was?


 Loading: Come on, come on, come on!


 Babaloga: Video jockeys. Video - video - video - video jockey! Fuck. Hass wants to know if we're still watching the movie.


 Loading: Tell Hass yes! Hass is free to join us. If he finds the warp, he can jump through it, Baba.


 Babaloga: He can - if he finds the warp - how does he know that? How does - how the fuck does he know that?


 Loading: He played the second game!


 Babaloga: I don't even know if Super Mario Brothers 2 has warp zones.


 Loading: Super Mario Brothers 1 has warp zones.


 Babaloga: Yeah, but Super Mario Brothers 2 was not designed as a Super Mario Brothers game.


 Loading: Okay, but maybe he played the first one.


 Babaloga: Yeah, but if the first one has it and the second one doesn't, why would you assume the third one has it?


 Loading: And... you can make an educated guess?


 Babaloga: It's explicitly an uneducated guess in this case.


 Loading: Oh no, that clearly said World 1. That's not what World 2 is. 


 Babaloga: World Two...


 Loading: Get the star. Jimmy!


 Babaloga: The star. Jimmy! Get the star.


 Loading: The star! Jimmy! Oh, shit.


 Babaloga: How the fuck does she know what the Magic Flute does?


 Loading: She read Nintendo Power! I love the energy of this host.


 Babaloga: It's fucked up that they had a woman on stage just to absolutely demolish her at a video game.


 Loading: It is fucked up. It was the eighties. It was a fucked up time.


 Babaloga: Yeah, it was a lot of fucked up stuff in the eighties. At least eighty fucked up things. I do - I love that guy throwing his clipboard, though. That makes up for it.


 Loading: I also love this set.


 Babaloga: I already said I love this set.


 Loading: You said I love that - I thought you said I love that this guy throws that clipboard.


 Babaloga: I did say that. But a while ago when we first saw this, that I was like, what the fuck is up with the set? 


 Loading: I love this.


 Babaloga: By which I meant, "I love this set".


 Loading: Yeah, we love this. We're pro this set from the end of The Wizard. We're pro Jimmy. We're big Jimmy fans here.


 Babaloga: By the way, who's this kid that you picked up along the way? You picked up a straggler? Who is this?


 Loading: Who is this loose child?


 Babaloga: Is this - is the brother gonna - why do you take his seatbelt off? Is he gonna jump out of the car? What the fuck was this kid in California?


 Loading: This kid wants California.


 Babaloga: Yeah, they got Dino Sauers. This is before Jurassic Park.


 Loading: Oh, he's trying to find the sniper companion from Fallout New Vegas.


 Babaloga: Yeah, I was gonna say. Yo there, Novak.


 Loading: Jerry Novak.


 Babaloga: Jimmy.


 Loading: Jimmy!


 Babaloga: Jimmy boy. Give me that shit. Give me that shit too.


 Loading: Aaaah.


 Babaloga: Da twin!


 Loading: This is good. And it's important that it's in the movie. You know, people aren't talking about twins dying. Baba, your twin sister could die any day now.


 Babaloga: God. That's true.


 Loading: It's so true. If you have a twin, if your Pepboy and you have a twin, remember to give your twin a hug, while you can. I wish I was good at video games so I didn't have to be put in a home.


 Babaloga: Yeah, but you're not. I've seen you play fucking Peak. 


 Loading: Look 


 Babaloga: What an extremely eighties way for this movie to end.


 Loading: Yeah. Are you glad we just did this, Baba?


 Babaloga: No.


 Loading: Are you as mad at me as thought you'd be?


 Babaloga: That's fucking. It's whatever. I wasn't paying attention for most of it.


 Loading: Yeah, I believe we watched this on Tri's recommendation. Anything you want to say to Tri as we wrap up?


 Babaloga: What - what are we saying things to Tri?


 Loading: 'Cause Tri recommended this movie. Tri said this movie was good.


 Babaloga: Uh, Tri - it's really troubling that you like this movie. There's a lot of troubling things that it says about you that you like this movie.


 Loading: As a father, as a man, as a human being.


 Babaloga: As a Mech.


 Loading: As a Mech, as a fan of the Core Mechanics. We're canceling you, Tri.


 Babaloga: That's it. Tri is over party.


 Loading: Tri is over.


 Babaloga: #TriIsOverParty


 Loading: We'd like to issue a formal apology for boosting Tri - EsotericTriangle on our platform. Uh, if we had known the things that he was capable of... we wouldn't have had him on.


 Babaloga: It's true. It's troubling. It's - it's - it's -


 Loading: It's troubling. 
 
 Babaloga: It's troubling. I'm troubled. All right. I'm not going to watch the credits for a movie that I didn't want to watch the movie of. Take that, the credits! The Wiz-zard!


 Loading: Anything you want to say to sign off?


 Babaloga: Oh, fuck. We did a podcast.


 Loading: We did a podcast! Yeah. No, we've been recording this.


 Babaloga: Shit. If any - if anyone's still here and did not just skip to the end, uh, send me the, uh, the boat emoji, but not the one the Dale uses.


 Loading: Also ping me and just say, hey, I finished the episode legitimately, gaps and all.


 Babaloga: I have a feeling, though, that, uh -


 Loading: Let us know if you if you watched it with or without the movie.


 Babaloga: Yeah. Let us know if you watched it at all. We have no other way of knowing this.


 Loading: No. True. We don't have metrics.


 Babaloga: Also, it's not watched. It's listen.


 Loading: Righ- no. I want to know if people watched the movie.


 Babaloga: No, no, but listen to this. Without the movie or watched the movie. 


 Loading: That's true.


 Babaloga: Or I guess you could watch this if you've got, like, a cool visualizer.


 Loading: Yeah. We should bring those back. Well.


 Babaloga: I regret that. Ending the recording.


 Loading: Yeah, me, too. This has been the Don't Listen To This Podcast.


 Babaloga: I'm already ending.


 Loading: Thank you. Fuck you. Goodbye.
