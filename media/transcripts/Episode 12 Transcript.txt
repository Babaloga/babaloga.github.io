Loading: All right. Welcome to the Babaloading podcast. We've got a very unspecial episode for you. This one's totally normal.

Babaloga: Yeah, but first, we do have some housekeeping that we should get to. Um...

Loading: Well first we have to read off the poem.

Babaloga: Oh, yeah. Sorry. Yeah, we had it sort of a non-standard opening, so. Yeah, you go ahead.

Loading: The stained cloth flies away and falls mid-air. A flock of white doves. It is an announcement for the war's end and the coming of peace. On the other side of this palm sized sky, massive flock of doves washes dirt from their feathers. On this side of the sky, a foul war begins, and the white doves are beaten to death with clubs. When ash darkens the air, the white doves will fly away once again under the other side of the palm sized sky. All right. Cool. Housekeeping.

Babaloga: What? That was such a fucked up poem.

Loading: Well, you have to remember, you wrote that poem, uh, during the Korean occu- or the Japanese occupation of Korea.

Babaloga: Okay.

Loading: Uh, his entire life was. It's all sort of about-

Babaloga: It's a wartime poem. 

Loading: Yeah. Well, so his entire life was during the Japanese occupation of Korea.

Babaloga: Yeah.

Loading: So you sort of always need to keep that in the back of your head when reading his poems.

Babaloga: I see... Uh, yeah. So the housekeeping, um, we noticed and I don't know how this happened because this- We're usually pretty on top of this, but, um, we it looks like skipped episode twelve? So we're gonna go back and catch episode twelve. Um, and then we'll proceed as normal from there. Uh, so this this is episode twelve, even though we're recording it after episode thirteen. I'm sorry. I know it's confusing, but, that's the...

Loading: Yeah we're, this is on us. This is, uh, something that happened on our end, and we cannot apologize enough for it.

Babaloga: Yeah.

Loading: Yeah.

Babaloga: Let's see. We were talking about doing a- a Herbie the Love Bug episode.

Loading: We were.

Babaloga: I haven't prepared at all for that, but we could still do it. Nothing's stopping us.

Loading: For anyone who doesn't know, Baba is a fan of Herbie the Love Bug and his many... his antics. 

Babaloga: Yeah!

Loading: When he goes bananas that one time

Babaloga: He did. He did go bananas one time. He went to Monte Carlo one time. He got fully loaded but we don't talk about that.

Loading: Why do we not talk about that?

Babaloga: Uh, because it was not a good movie.

Loading: [Laughs] All right. 

Babaloga: I'm. I'm going to refrain from making any statements about the quality of the other movies, but I will say that her Herbie Fully Loaded was not a good movie.

Loading: So how'd you how'd you learn to come to love Herbie and his many antics?

Babaloga: So when I was a kid, we had a box set of the the then existing Herbie movies. Um, and so, yeah, I just I watched them all from a very young age. Uh, the original one where the car gets cut in half and he's still going around the racetrack like a lil' scamp. Uh, and then the sequels, where things continue to happen to and around the car, and then, you know, you go out into the world and people have painted their their Volkswagen beetles, like like Herbie. And you're like, hey, I know that guy. That's my favorite guy Herbie.

Loading: There's the spider one in the Wizard.

Babaloga: The spider- Yes! Yeah, yeah.

Loading: Yeah the spider.

Babaloga: That that giant black spider VW bug was, of course, the villain of Herbie and the Haunted racetrack. That's a lie. I would never-

Loading: You all saw the wizard. You all saw the spider.

Babaloga: Listen, I don't want to deceive anyone about something as important as Herbie, so I just want everyone to know that. That that was a joke. There's no giant black spider VW bug.

Loading: I mean, for you, I've often heard it said, you know, there's sort of two great figures in your life. And the first one is, of course, Jesus Christ.

Babaloga: Yeah. Of course. Big fan of the J-man.

Loading: Yeah. And the second one is Herbie. So, like, how do you square your sort of love for those two?

Babaloga: Um, basically, I... Every time at night when I pray right before I go to bed, I imagine Herbie the Love bug up on the cross. And that brings a tear to my eye, a tear of joy. Because I know that Herbie died for our sins.

Loading: Yeah?

Babaloga: Yeah.

Loading: And, uh, we're here to talk about that.

Babaloga: I think, actually, maybe that's it. Maybe we just did talk about. 

Loading: Maybe that's it.

Babaloga: Because I didn't rewatch any of the movies in preparation for this, so...

Loading: No? I feel like at the end of every recording we do, whether it's on the podcast or not, one of us offhandedly says something and that fixes it in my mind is, that's our next episode, and then I don't vocalize it.

Babaloga: Yeah. And and for me, as soon as we're finished recording the podcast, the podcast no longer exists. 

Loading: That's true.

Babaloga: It's deceased, so... That's why they call it a postmortem.

Loading: That's why they call it the blues.

Babaloga: That- I... Yes, you're right, and you should say it more.

Loading: I should say it.

Babaloga: So how was your week?

Loading: Uh, my week was all right. I got to watch The Thing at a friend's house. There was a charcuterie board.

Babaloga: What? What kind of thing?

Loading: The kind of thing that's directed by John Carpenter and was poorly received at release.

Babaloga: You know, I know of another carpenter who directed some people to do some things. [Laughs]

Loading: Mm-hm? What's his name?

Babaloga: His name is Herbie, the love bug.

Loading: [Laughs] Ah, fuck.

Babaloga: So that's what you did for Halloween?

Loading: No, that's what I did on the Thursday before Halloween. On Halloween I just played a bunch of limbus company like a chump.

Babaloga: I can't imagine you playing limbus company.

Loading: I am trying very hard to minimize the amount of limbus company I talk about.

Babaloga: It's got its hooks in you.

Loading: It's got its hooks in me really bad and I've been talking about it a lot lately, and I'm like, I need to talk about other things. And so I've been playing Pokemon ZA and Noita.

Babaloga: How is that?

Loading: ZA?

Babaloga: Yeah. 

Loading: Or Noita?

Babaloga: No, no. ZA.

Loading: I really like it. I think in two iterations, uh, the battle system that's in ZA will be something that's, like, really, really special.

Babaloga: Is it different from Arceus?

Loading: Yeah. So Arceus still had, like, an element of, uh, of turn based-ness That has been sort of iterated on. It's a lot more movement, a lot more timing, a lot more kineticism...

Babaloga: Interesting.

Loading: ...in this one. Uh, it's it's honestly a really interesting game. I recommend it if you've got money for it.

Babaloga: Yeah. I mean, like, whether it's a responsible financial decision?

Loading: I mean, you're buying, you're buying and playing so many games right now.

Babaloga: Yeah. Like, the real obstacle is that I probably won't have time to play it. I am- I did like Arceus quite a bit, whereas I feel like I've always really liked the idea of Pokemon games, and I have never really been able to get into any of them.

Loading: I- the the only time I've really, truly- like I, I enjoy Pokemon game. I like playing through them. The only time I've ever finished a Dex is, uh, this year actually. A friend of mine, we both picked up Scarlet Violet and we were like, okay, we're gonna finish the entire Dex together. And that was really fun. I really enjoyed doing that. I like a monster tamer game. I'm a big fan of Monster Sanctuary. I really love Cassette Beasts. I think a lot of the indie ones are more interesting to me than Pokemon proper is.

Babaloga: I should check out some of the indie ones then, because-

Loading: So Monster sanctuary is a weird one. That one's got like three V3 battles with this like weird combo system. That's really interesting. Uh, it's also very debuff oriented, which is really fun. And then, uh, they're working on a game currently, which is a roguelike called Aether Mancer, which has just absolutely breathtaking sprite art.

Babaloga: I feel like where I tend to fall flat with Pokemon or where Pokemon tends to fall flat for me, is I really like the idea of a monster capture game. You know, a good beast get-em? But I'm not a big fan of RPGs it turns out.

Loading:Really? 

Babaloga: Like the- I'm not somebody for whom a number going up is like a big reward. And so like any sort of game with a leveling system where like the leveling system is like an integral part of the game structure. It's generally, I think, going to fall a little flat for me.

Loading: You see, I'm the exact opposite. I don't like number go up. I like complexity go up. 

Babaloga: Mm. 

Loading: Uh, I like when like more like I like an RPG battle system where the further into the game you get the more tools you have at your disposal. Which is why I really like job systems as a player.

Babaloga: Yeah. I mean, like that's increasing complexity and like that sort of thing. I'm all on board for. But anything, especially anything where you need to grind. Grinding is such a brick wall for me in any game that I just like...

Loading: That's that's what in the Final Fantasy five pixel remaster, a game that I really love playing. There is a setting to tweak how much XP and job points and encounter gives, and that just took all the grinding out. And it was really fun. Uh, because I don't think I the XP curve for that game is pretty good. Taking out job point grinding was huge.

Babaloga: Nice. I don't know what job points are.

Loading: But, uh, job points just let you do jobs. The job's better. Yeah.

Babaloga: Nice. [Laughs]

Loading: It's a it's it's the job based class system. It's Final Fantasy five.

Babaloga: Of course. Yeah. Final fantasy five and I definitely played not only that one, but also all of the other... games.

Loading: You played all the Final Fantasies?

Babaloga: Yep. All of them.

Loading: All of- all of thirteen?

Babaloga: Even seventeen. Yep.

Loading: What about eleven?

Babaloga: Yep. All the way through.

Loading: Nine. 

Babaloga: Title to credits. Yep.

Loading: Two.

Babaloga: Yep.

Loading: Three. 

Babaloga: Uh-Huh.

Loading: One.

Babaloga: No.

Loading: Yeah that makes sense.

Babaloga: [Laughing] Loading I don't want to spread misinformation on the internet. I have played Final Fantasy one.

Loading: Is it the only one you've played?

Babaloga: No, I haven't played any of them. I haven't played a single Final Fantasy game.

Loading: That woulda been really funny. You're like, well, I played one. I quite enjoyed it, but I think I was done after that.

Babaloga: I played one when it came out several years before I was born. And then...

Loading: Times change. I don't know, sometimes you just like, are born into this world and as a young child you just have weird old games. I had Final Fantasy adventure for the GBA.

Babaloga: Yeah, I mostly had like Zoo Tycoon. Zoombinis had a lot of all three of the Zoombinis games, and most people who know that the Zoombinis exist do not know that there was more than one.

Loading: Okay, so as a kid we had, of course, the the family computer. That was really pretty much just me at all times.

Babaloga: The Famicom, yeah.

Loading: And a whole bunch of- not an actual Famicom, um, like a CRT screen, that sort of thing, and just a whole bunch of CD-ROM games. Did you have this experience? 

Babaloga: Yeah

Loading: Yeah. Where you just had like a, like a CD case full of, like weird CD rom games and you'd be like, I want to play Muppets Treasure Island for the for the computer game.

Babaloga: I don't think I ever had that one. We definitely had a Winnie the Pooh game. We actually, if I remember correctly, it had like a special plastic toy component that like, would fit over your keyboard.

Loading: I had a Thomas the Tank Engine, one that had something like that. That's pretty cool. We should bring that back.

Babaloga: I think, honestly, it's just that keyboard layouts weren't standardized enough.

Loading: That makes sense.

Babaloga: And they're even less so now. But you could probably do something like that with game controllers.

Loading: Probably. Have you seen the six button Street Fighter two for console controller?

Babaloga: I mean, don't a lot of consoles have like specific fighter pad controllers?

Loading: There's like gamepads, but this is like shaped like a controller for the PlayStation one that had six buttons on one side, which is really interesting.

Babaloga: It's the original. Um, they didn't have a name for the controller yet, did they? Because the DualShock was not the first generation PlayStation controller.

Loading: It was not I. It was probably just PlayStation controller.

Babaloga: You know, it's funny. PlayStation, all of their controllers have a name except for the first one, and Xbox, none of their controllers have a name except for the first one.

Loading: Interesting. Wait, the first Xbox controller had a name?

Babaloga: Yeah, it's called the Duke.

Loading: No, I don't think it is.

Babaloga: It is, yeah!

Loading: I deny this.

Babaloga: It's it's the like, big, weirdly disc shaped one.

Loading: Oh, I had it. I had it growing up.

Babaloga: Yeah. The nickname for that controller is the Duke.

Loading: Fun fact as a kid I got like an Xbox from my uncle because he was like, we don't need this anymore. So my parents were like, cool, I'll take it from you. Uh, and we got, like, all his games with it. And among that was Tony Hawk's Pro Skater two. Right?

Babaloga: Yeah.

Loading: I was not. My parents sold that game because they would turn off the blood from when you, like, eat shit.

Babaloga: And you would turn it back on?

Loading: Yeah. I figured out how to navigate the menu as a kid to turn the blood back on.

Babaloga: You wanted to see blood so bad that you got the game removed from your life.

Loading: Truly. No, like as a kid, I was, like, repeatedly eating shit in my parents. Like, why are you doing that? And I'm like, it makes a pool of blood every time. And that just, like, blew my little kid brain like.

Babaloga: I do wonder if that's one of those things where it's like, you want to... So is it like a persistent pool of blood?

Loading: I don't think I think it's just like a sticker that's there for a while.

Babaloga: Yeah. So but like, you respawn and it's still there. 

Loading: Yeah. 

Babaloga: For a while. Yeah. I feel like that's there's like an instinct in games where you're like, you just want to have an impact on the world. There's this-

Loading: Yes.

Babaloga: -this anecdote from the development of one of the uncharted games, where there's like a sequence after a big action set piece where Nathan Drake is in like a mountain village somewhere, and it's like there's it's a no combat section. You're just like walking around. There's a bunch of people, a bunch of stuff to see. And their playtesters kept going around and punching everyone, and they were like, why? How? What's wrong with our playtesters? How do we get them to stop doing this? And they made it- They removed your ability to punch was the first thing they tried. And playtesters complained. They were like, well, what? What the hell? Like, this feels bad. And so in their next attempt or in I don't know how many attempts it took to to arrive at this conclusion, they replaced the punch action with waving. So when you hit punch, instead, Nathan Drake waved and people were so happy with that. They were so on board because all they wanted was to be able to, like, behave expressively, to not feel like they were constrained to not being able to do anything. Like they just wanted to make a little impact on the w-
[Beeping Sound]
Ooh, my soup is done. One second.

Loading: [Mimicking Baba] Ooh! Guys. Baba's soup is done. I know you know what? I have no room to complain about Bamba getting up and getting his soup at this point. Because I did this on the Tri ep. Uh, but Tri was there. It was good. That was a good and interesting conversation. Hacc, how are you feeling about this? Do you think this is a good episode? Okay, well, you don't have to put it like that. Fuck you too. Piece of shit.

Babaloga: Okay. I'm back.

Loading: Hacc is being the worst.

Babaloga: What's up with Hacc?

Loading: She's being a bitch.

Babaloga: Whoa! That's crazy.

Loading: I know. Anyway, uh, players like to have agency. Just like in real life how we have agency because of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

Babaloga: Who is that?

Loading: Uh, he's like Herbie, the love bug.

Babaloga: Oohhhh

Loading: Yeah.

Babaloga: So I actually on Halloween, I went to the Halloween parade here in in New Yoak City.

Loading: Oh, that sounds fun. Did you dress up or did you just go watch?

Babaloga: Uh, I was dressed up. I was actually dressed up as a Blaseball player because the other costume I had turned out to kind of suck, and I was like, I've got the Blaseball jersey and the hat, and I'll just do that. No one will recognize it. And guess what? No one did!

Loading: Tragedy.

Babaloga: Uh, but yeah, we didn't actually see much of the parade. It's it's like insanely crowded. So...

Loading: Yeah, that makes sense. And you're tiny, you're short.

Babaloga: Yeah. 

Loading: You're like a little guy.

Babaloga: I'm like, three foot negative two, so...

Loading: Yeah, you're like six inches tall.

Babaloga: I'm knee high to a grasshopper, which, like, the knees are pretty high up on a grasshopper so...

Loading: Yeah. And grasshoppers notoriously have really long knees like the rest of their bodies. Like tiny, but like, the knee makes up, like, over twice the length of their body.

Babaloga: Yeah. So, like, knee high to a grasshopper is really, like, it's about as tall as you could be relative to a grasshopper.

Loading: Yeah.

Babaloga: But it's. I'm gonna be honest. Not all that tall.

Loading: It's the tallest part of the grasshopper, yeah. And I know that's made dating particularly hard for you out there. Uh, just not a lot of people that small.

Babaloga: Yeah, no, it's true, but ladies love a guy who can fit in their pocket.

[Both Laughing]

Loading: I was so concerned about what that last word was gonna be.

[Long Pause]

Babaloga: What do you mean? 

[Long Pause]

Loading: Moving on. 

[Both Laughing]

Babaloga: Yeah. So that's. There... the reason the the parade came to mind is there were a bunch of people preaching around there, which is not terribly surprising. Any sort of, like, public event is like the main town in a Bethesda game. There's going to be someone proselytizing.

Loading: I mean, I assume you were out there to proselytize the good word?

Babaloga: Yeah, yeah, I was shouting about Blaseball, how it died for our sins and it will be coming back someday.

Loading: Fuck, dude. Jesus. you didn't have to hit me with that one. This is going into Mechscord, dude!

Babaloga: Yeah! Listen, these are the only people I can make that joke to. The only people who will get it.

Loading: You know what? That's true. We love you. Listeners... of podcast.

Babaloga: There was- shout out to the person on Thursday who recognized that I was wearing a Blaseball jersey, and they were on the Mills.

Loading: That makes sense.

Babaloga: Yeah. So I don't know if they'll see this. And also, I didn't get their name.

Loading: Send this, send this to the Mills.

Babaloga: Whoever's listening to this, because I'm sure as shit not gonna do it.

Loading: If anyone's dual teaming with Mills.

Babaloga: What is dual teaming even mean anymore?

Loading: Uh, just that you're on an active in multiple servers. I'm active in the Tacos, the Dale, and Mechscord.

Babaloga: Didn't- Weren't the mills one of the ones that didn't have a server?

Loading: No, I think Mills very notoriously had a server, if anything.

Babaloga: Oh, hang on.

Loading: Let me, let me. I'm actually in Millscord.

Babaloga: I'm in all of them. I just don't remember Mills being among them.

Loading: Okay. Millscord appears to be dead.

Babaloga: Is Millscord dead? Oh, no.

Loading: Is Millscord dead?

Babaloga: [Quietly] RIP Millscord?

Loading: What was the last Millscord [Indistinct]?

Babaloga: Yeah. The only person... it's- the general is just soup and quantum ducky going back and forth saying-

Loading: That's general Blaseball, though. That's general Blaseball, I saw that.

Babaloga: Okay, so welcome zone, automated content, lore zone. Off topic. Is it off topic that's alive?

Loading: Okay, this appears to be dead. Dead as hell.

Babaloga: That's sad.

Loading: RIV to the Mills, everyone. It'll happen to all of us in time.

Babaloga: Not me. I'm built different.

Loading: We've beguney with the money. So I'm recording this the day after. Because a thing was brought to my attention that I want to promote that I didn't know about the day of. So my friend Ivy, who you may know from being Blaseball adjacent, or if you're into Splatoon, you may know her from the Slammin Cup. She is going to be raising money for Sick Kids Children's Hospital, uh, this year by playing Hollow Knight Silksong this weekend, the very weekend that this comes out from Saturday the eighth to Monday the tenth, working with Extra Life, she's going to get through the game's hardest mode Steel, Steel Soul and Hollow Knight Silksong. If you don't know, it's if you die, you restart. It's the sort of it's Iron Man mode from Xcom. You know, Xcom, you love Xcom. It's not just that, but she's doing a what's the word for it, like a crowd control, so you can donate money to her and she'll swap out what shit she's using in the game, like her crest and stuff, so that you can just really, really just fuck her over. Or you can make her have a cool little outfit. So, uh, the URL that you are going to look up is https://www.extra-life.org/participants/SteelSoul4TheKids. And that should be that link should be somewhere below if Hacc did her job right. There's some cool stuff here. Uh, she's got donation goals all set up and things like that. Uh, for instance, at four hundred dollars, Ivy has agreed to make a video, I believe, about how Hornet is gay? Four hundred dollars USD. I quote I'll make a video essay entitled Is Hornet a lesbian? A well-researched investigation? Eight hundred dollars USD, an extra four hours of streaming one thousand. She does the secret boss for Steel Soul. These are all cool things that Ivy has opted to do with her time. She's giving her time. Pop in. Watch it. Just by watching even these streams, you can sort of boost where they are in the algorithm. More people get recommended it on Twitch, more people jump in, more people are able to donate. So just come on, drop on by or donate if you can. I think that's it. Baba, you got anything to say?

Babaloga: [Encubed] F????????r?????e??????e???? ???????m?????e?????? ????f????r?????????o??????m?????? ??????t???h??????e??????? ?????C??????u????b??????e??????

Loading: All right. Thanks. We've we are done with the money.

Babaloga: Loading. Have you seen the late seventies Japanese horror comedy movie House?

Loading: What? Like where the... [Sighs] Where the doctor does a Sherlock Holmes? I sighed deeply because I'm like, that's the only joke I could make here. I paused too long. I can't say no.

Babaloga: Listen, not to throw Hacc under the bus, but Hacc made the exact same joke without even a tenth of that self-awareness.

Loading: Hacc keep this in.

Babaloga: Oh, no. Hacc is shooting me.

Loading: Me. Keep it in and double it.

Hacceuee: Fucking rude. My jokes are great. Hold on. I can fix this.

[Typing Sounds]

Babaloga (Real): Hacc made the exact same joke in, like, a delightful way.

Hacceuee: Yeah, surely that's what he meant.

Babaloga: Yeah. No, it's just a super weird movie. We watched it on, so there's, uh, the the guy who's in charge of the game library here-

Loading: I feel like I've heard of it.

Babaloga: House? Yeah, I hadn't, but you might have. You seem more tapped into that sort of scene.

Loading: I listened to several movie podcasts.

Babaloga: Yeah. It's like truly a bizarre movie in, like, a delightful way. There's a point where a cat psychically makes a crystal drop from a chandelier, and a character named Kung Fu leaps into action, flies through the air, kicks that crystal into the wall in like an elaborate action sequence. And then another crystal falls and kills a lizard. And around that point I was like, I think this is the best movie I've ever seen.

Loading: Why are we not watching this movie right now?

Babaloga: Well, because we watched The Wizard instead. And whose fault is that?

Loading: You know what? You could have said it. I said this was the Herbie the Love Bug episode where we sing his praises. Don't worry. We'll close with a hymn.

Babaloga: Yeah, we. We speak his prophecy.

Loading: We speak his prophecy.

Babaloga: We spread the good word of Herbie, the love bug.

Loading: We go bananas.

[Both Laughing]

Babaloga: Um, yeah. Just truly, truly a wild film. So that's sort of been my week as those two things. Oh, no. The the phone. I promised the phone thing on Mechscord I would talk about what happened to my phone.

Loading: You did promise the phone thing. Tell me about the phone.

Babaloga: All right. So I'll do this in chronological order.

Loading: Actually, can you do it in non-chronological order? Can you jump around?

Babaloga: Nnno...

Loading: Okay.

Babaloga: I would consider doing it for the bit, but it sounds like a lot of work actually on my part. So Monday morning I wake up my phone's alarms going off, but when I try to wake my phone to turn off the alarm, the screen just goes black and I'm like, hmm. So my phone has an OLED screen, and so it's got an always-on display that it will do when it's not like awake. And that is working. But as soon as it wakes up, the screen just goes black. Sometimes there's like a little white flash at the top of the screen, but normally it just goes black, and then you hit the thing to put it back to sleep. And the always-on display comes up. So I'm like, okay, seems like a software problem. My alarm is still actively going off, which is really annoying and distracting. And it's literally six in the morning. It's still dark outside. I just woke up, but I, I hold the power button in the up volume key or whatever. Actually, I think I have to come over to my computer and like, Google how to force power off an Android phone because it's not just holding the power button anymore.

Loading: Uh? why would they change that?

Babaloga: I don't know... But yeah. So I get it shut down and I turn it back on and my alarm immediately starts going off again, because I guess we're close enough to the time that it's still triggering, but the screen is not fixed and I'm like, shit. So I sit there for like thirty to forty minutes trying to get this resolved, finding different ways of restarting it and being like, what's going on with this thing? No progress. And so I'm like, whatever. I have an old phone lying around, swap the SIM cards, get on my way to school. And that's basically, you know, I kept trying to revive it over the course of the week, basically, and nothing was working. I came to the conclusion because the hard reset didn't fix it, that it was probably a hardware problem. Like there was like a short in the cables that connected to the screen. So like when the voltage going to the screen increased, it stopped working. Something like that. I yeah, like put in a ticket with Google support because it's a pixel phone. And I was like reaching out to local support places like, hey, can you give me a quote on this sort of thinking about maybe it'll be cheaper to replace than to repair, because repairs on these phones can be pretty expensive.
And then on Friday, I sit down, I'm like, all right, here's the plan. I'm going to put the screen. I'm going to get the video out, I'm going to plug in a keyboard and a mouse, and I'm going to see if I can actually operate this phone with even with the screen dead the way it is. Like, can I log into it? 

Loading: Okay...?

Babaloga: And it turns out, and this is the most bullshit thing in this whole story, to be honest. Pixel phones have their video output disabled. Like the video out via USB-C does not work on any pixel phones. I guess to encourage people to cast instead, but like extremely annoying. 

Loading: Yeah, that sucks.

Babaloga: I bought a specific adapter from Microcenter to do this and it didn't work. I actually returned it earlier today. And so. But what I do manage to do is there is a, an accessibility feature called TalkBack that you can use Google Assistant to turn on. And so I do that, and I'm sort of fumbling through blind navigating the phone using talkback, which like reads out the... what's currently on the screen. It acts as a screen reader, but like for your Android phone. And so it's sort of a different way of using it. And it's really annoying in some places. Uh, and it's very unclear about what's going on in some places. Uh, and we need probably better accessibility tools just across the board, to be honest. But eventually I get to... I'm trying to connect it to my computer. I have my USB stuff set up in such a way where it's not actually like I can't access it from my computer. And so I'm trying to get that turned around. And I eventually do manage to get that configured so that my, the debug, the Android debug tools on my computer can actually like mirror the screen to the computer. And then I'm like, all right, great. Fantastic. We've got it. I can see the screen and then something pulls me away. I think I just had to work on something. And I was like, all right, but we've got that set up. I can poke around there and if I need to, I can get all of my stuff off transferred to a new phone. And then I go over, like I walk away, and then I hear the phone talking, just like out loud to nobody in particular. This is maybe like an hour later, actually. And I come back and the screen is on. It just it just fixed itself like six days after it broke for no apparent reason, within like an hour of me, like poking around with it and doing a bunch of software stuff. It just fixed itself. So I, I don't know, and I'm worried it's going to break again, but it hasn't.

Loading: I'd be worried that your phone's just fully been hacked.

Babaloga: I don't think... first of all, like, mobile operating systems are pretty difficult to hack. 

Loading: That's true. 

Babaloga: Um, I don't go around just, like, downloading shady links and giving them root permissions on my phone.

Loading: I. So- you've learned your lesson.

Babaloga: But, yeah, I mean, I don't, I don't know. Sometimes computers do just fix themselves. And so that's...

Loading: Did I ever tell you what happened? What? I had to replace my phone last year. Right. Did I ever tell you that story?

Babaloga: I don't think so.

Loading: Okay. So last. This is very funny. So last year, my phone stopped charging, right? I know, here's the thing you need to know about me in my electronics. I use my electronics until they fucking die.

Babaloga: Right?

Loading: I got that phone refurbished for one hundred and ten dollars in high school. Use that thing for like, eight years, and now it's dead. Uh, so this is a cheap phone. I used it forever, I so I'm, like, freaking out and stuff, right? So I'm like, okay, what do I actually use my phone for? I'm like, I use it to message my parents and stuff occasionally, and I use it for my alarms. I'm like, well, fuck, my alarms are all gone right now. So I had to sort that out, right? So I'm like, well, what's the fa- Because I need to get up for work in the morning. So what's the fastest way to get an alarm? So I go to the local grocery store and I buy a kitchen timer.

Babaloga: Oh my God.

Loading: Yeah. And I used this kitchen timer as, like, a pocket watch with two alarms on it for the next week. I'm carrying around a kitchen timer and I'll tell you what. The kitchen timer. Fucking MVP of the year. God damn that thing. It did- I needed it to do exactly one thing. It did it fucking incredibly.

Babaloga: So, wait, what was the maximum time you could set on it?

Loading: Twenty four hours.

Babaloga: Oh, wow. That's pretty long for a kitchen timer.

Loading: It's a digital kitchen timer. I don't- it also told the time I'm like, this is the best. I can just set an eight hour timer before I go to bed. And it's easy. So yeah, I love a kitchen timer.

Babaloga: I could have.

Loading: Done anyway. And then I cheaped out on my next phone.

Babaloga: Yeah, I mean, if it if it lasted you, like, eleven years or whatever.

Loading: Yeah. Truly, I am of the opinion that phones the only reason I didn't get like a flip phone is because I have to have, I've gotta have like multi factor apps for work.

Babaloga: So you don't use your phone for anything else?

Loading: Not- I mean, I use it for, like, Spotify, but. Yeah.

Babaloga: Yeah. Because I feel like the the thing that irks me about using older phones is that they really start to chug in certain use cases.

Loading: They do. I'll give you that.

Babaloga: But like, if it really if it lasted for that long. Like, what model of phone was it?

Loading: Uh, I don't- I think I threw it out.

Babaloga: Do you know the make?

Loading: No idea. Because like I said, it was refurbished. It was even older than that. Um, yeah, I have no idea. It was like an old. I think it was like a J... Galaxy J4. I told the let me let me look this up.

Babaloga: The Galaxy J line is like, because I, I know a couple other people who have Galaxy J phones and they're like the they're not the the main Galaxy flagship line, but they're like really solid lower range phones.

Loading: Yeah, there's the Galaxy J4, released in 2018. I had that fucker for seven years when I when I called in to like Verizon to be like, okay, can I get an estimate on how much this phone would take to replace? And they're like, what fucking model is it? I'm like, it's a J4. And there he goes. I don't think I've ever seen a J4. And I've been working this job for years. I'm like, I don't know what to tell you, man. I got an old phone.

Babaloga: Galaxy J4 announced and released along with the J6 and J8. The J4 is the successor to the J3. Wait, now hang on.

[Both Laugh]

Loading: Wait a minute.

Babaloga: So they presumably did J2 and J3. And then they were like, all right, now here's the J4 6 and 8. Oh no. The J- there looks like maybe there wasn't a J2. So that makes a little more sense.

Loading: Does it?

Babaloga: The- the numbering system is apparently arbitrary then.

Loading: Yeah.

Babaloga: So like the J3 was a pretty successful phone they had. And then to follow it up they released a J4 6 and 8.

Loading: Anyway, I currently have a Motorola like a Motorola smartphone that was like one hundred and four dollars.

Babaloga: I feel like Motorola is sort of the workhorse brand of the smartphone world.

Loading: Yeah, I mean, it's it's definitely a cheap phone. I mean, I can feel it. It chugs with a lot of things, but like, it does exactly what I need it to do, you know?

Babaloga: Yeah.

Loading: Anyway, everyone buy kitchen timers just in case. They'll save your ass.

Babaloga: Or have an old phone laying around.

Loading: Or just get, like a cheap ten dollars watch. Which is what I did recently because I went to a Larp.

Babaloga: Well, because here's the thing. Like, if all I needed was my alarms, then yeah, I probably would have been fine with like some other device, but like, my phone is doing a lot of stuff.

Loading: What do you do with your phone?

Babaloga: Well, I use it to communicate with people. I use it to keep track of my schedule and what needs doin'. I use it to check my emails when I'm at school, and I don't want to pull out my laptop and boot it up because my laptop is old as shit. It's not even that old. It's just bad. Um, and then, uh, yeah. And so like, all the all the stuff. It's like, well, now I could just swap it into the this old, perfectly functional phone that I have laying around. Yeah, it's sort of an advantage to the the more consumerist way of interacting because you, you have fallbacks.

Loading: Yes. So any good games for game school lately? What have you been playing?

Babaloga: Oh, boy. I haven't actually been playing much. I haven't had time.

Loading: Really? I thought you were in gamer school for gamers.

Babaloga: Yeah, well, we spent a lot of time making games. We don't spend all of our time playing them.

Loading: You're out here playing StarCraft two.

Babaloga: I've never once played StarCraft two, and I don't intend to.

Loading: I've also never played StarCraft two. What if we get really into StarCraft two next episode?

Babaloga: Loading, what did I just say?

Loading: I don't know, I talked over it.

Babaloga: I said I'd never once gotten- I've never once played StarCraft two, and I don't plan to.

Loading: Okay, well, now we're planning to.

Babaloga: No, I don't.

Loading: Yeah. Me neither.

Babaloga: Did you hear they're putting Halo on the PlayStation?

Loading: No.

Babaloga: Yeah, the the, uh, remake of the original Halo. And then also apparently all subsequent Halo games are going to release on PlayStation as well.

Loading: I don't know how I feel about that.

Babaloga: I don't feel much of anything about that.

Loading: I think that's ultimately what I've come down on. So what you've told me is nothing. This is nothing Babaloga, from Mechscord.

Babaloga: I- because I've liked a lot of the Halo games, but like, I feel like caring about whether Halo is on Xbox in anything other than like an analytical perspective of like, [Business Guy Voice] oh, is this a good play for Xbox from the business perspective? Like-

Loading: Well, Xbox isn't a console.

Babaloga: Yeah, they've sort of ditched the console market, which is the the real like news here. Is that like: okay, they're they're releasing it. Right. Like there's they're not holding on to anything.

Loading: I think Microsoft is probably put their hands into like a PC console thing where they're more about games. Now, I think PlayStation fills its niche as just a way to play the most modern games, which is a good and important niche, I think, within the market.

Babaloga: Yeah, but it's weird, like, PlayStation now, and I believe I'm actually borrowing this. This turn of phrase from Fully Ramblomatic. But PlayStation now feels like the only company that turned up to the console war. Like they're still acting like the console war is a thing.

Loading: I mean, Nintendo won. Nintendo won the console war.

Babaloga: Yeah, I mean, I guess, but Nintendo's not really. Nintendo has never been competing with anybody else.

Loading: No.

Babaloga: Like, sometimes they do well, sometimes they do poorly, but it tends to be pretty detached from how anybody else is doing.

Loading: Yeah, I don't know. How do we know how well the Switch 2 has sold so far?

Babaloga: Uh, I have no idea. I don't follow that kind of news anymore.

Loading: Yeah, no. Me either. I don't know. Have you been enjoying your Switch 2? You haven't had a lot of time to play it, have you?

Babaloga: No. I played a decent amount of Mario Kart World, and...

Loading: You're a Mario Kart guy.

Babaloga: I was really big on Mario Kart 8. I played a lot of it over the course of its eleven years or whatever.

Loading: I do not like- I'm not a Mario Kart guy. Not even a little bit.

Babaloga: Yeah, you're not a racer. You're a fighter.

Loading: I am a fighter.

Babaloga: And it speaks ill to your character. But I forgive you for it.

Loading: It does. And you know, racers are all God- Godful heathens, I guess?

Babaloga: Godful heath.

Loading: Yeah.

Babaloga: Godful Heathcliffs

Loading: They've got their one god. And it's- Heathcliff from Wuthering Heights?

Babaloga: No, Heathcliff from the newspaper comic.

Loading: I like Heathcliff. It's a fun comic.

Babaloga: I have a ham helmet.

Loading: No-

Babaloga: SHIT. That would have been a really good Halloween costume.

Loading: Fuck! Next year, Ham helmets, both of us. We'll get together, we'll match. It'll be cool.

Babaloga: All right. But you have to come to New York. I'm gonna have classes.

Loading: All right. This is. That's a good outfit, actually.

Babaloga: There's somebody in my cohort who was dressed up as, um, uh, Disco Elysium guy.

Loading: Oh, Kim Kisaragi or Harry Dubois.

Babaloga: Harry, uh, I did, I saw a Kim Kisaragi on the street. Uh, yeah, but I didn't. I didn't know him personally, but, yeah, he was a really good Harry Dubois, too. He had the. He had the tie. That was actually the tie from the game. Apparently it was like merch. And then he had like the exact coat.

Loading: Nice.

Babaloga: The green. Yeah. So that was cool.

Loading: That is cool. But next year we're getting ham helmets.

Babaloga: Ham helmets. Hamlets, if you will.

Loading: Hamlets.

Babaloga: Uh, don't mention hamlet in a fuckin' theater. They'll kill you.

Loading: I think that's Macbeth.

Babaloga: I'm pretty sure no Macbeth is bad luck. If you mention hamlet, they'll kill you.

Loading: Is that how that works?

Babaloga: Yeah.

Loading: Yeah, that makes sense. Anyway, this was a pretty good episode of the podcast, but also pretty slow and boring. And just me and Baba having a nice conversation. If you don't like it-

Babaloga: Do we want to do one gimmicky thing?

Loading: We can? I mean.

Babaloga: I don't I don't have any ideas, I just-

Loading: We, we have no gimmicks. We're wrapping up the episode here. I think if you want to, if you want to complain about us or if you want to encourage us, you can check us out on tumblr.com...

Babaloga: Yeah.

Loading: Yeah.

Babaloga: Just find us. We're. We're somewhere.

Loading: Find us. We're somewhere.

Babaloga: We've given you all the clues.

Loading: We've- We've given- We're in Mechscord. That's all the clues.

Babaloga: Find us on Mechscord. If you're listening to this, you're already on there. You already know where to find us. So why are you asking us to tell you where to find us? Like. 

Loading: Yeah. 

Babaloga: Come on. Have have a little bit of self-awareness please.

Loading: Fuck it, tell us where to find you! Where- Where are you, motherfucker? We're telling you our lat long right now!

Babaloga: Honestly, based on, like, the feedback that we got from the previous episode, I'm pretty sure that maybe at the high end, five people are going to listen to this or read the transcript.

Loading: Has anyone ever at-ed you because of something we said in episode.

Babaloga: Uh, somebody DM'd me. I believe Shork DM'd me some of the emojis from the Wizard episode.

Loading: From the Wizard episode. We should do another Wizard episode. They're good for engagement.

Babaloga: Or we could just ask people to DM us things.

Loading: We could ask. We do. We constantly say DM Babaloga.

Babaloga: DM- okay, if you if you get this far and you're in the audio version of it, DM me your favorite Blaseball gif.

Loading: If you're if you got this far and you're only reading the transcript, or if you're doing both, DM me a gif of Fishmael.

Babaloga: Don't do. If you're doing both. That'll pollute the data. You don't get clean data that way.

Loading: That's true if you're only reading the cran- transcript, the cranscript, the cranberry transcript.

Babaloga: Yes, it is November.

Loading: Send me a GIF of Fishmael from Limbus Company.

Babaloga: Okay. If anybody sends me a gif of Fishmael, I will block you on discord. And I'm not joking.

Loading: He's not kidding.

Babaloga: Don't test me. This is not a bit. I will block you. Not even for any particular reason. Just because I've. I've said this now and I stand by my word. But don't test it, because I will do it.

Loading: If you're doing both, uh, DM hacceuee that's at user h-a-c-c-e-u-e-e on discord.

Babaloga: Uh, that's user h-e-double-hockey-sticks.

Loading: DM them a picture of a rat. DM them a picture of a rat. Just the largest file you can find and send through discord. That's a picture of a rat. Yeah.

Babaloga: All right. I think that's a nice present you just gave Hacc.

Loading: That's good! Do you have anything? Anything to anything to say at the end here. Baba?

Babaloga: Um, I would like to recite a poem, but I won't.

Loading: Thank you. Fuck you. Goodbye.

Babaloga: Loading has wrapped up his recording, but I'm still recording. This is just between you and me, listeners. This is my little secret area of the podcast. How are you doing? Everybody- Loading can hear me. But he can't respond anymore because he stopped recording. How are y'all doing? That's pretty cool. All right, well, hey, I'll see you later, but thanks for tuning in, I appreciate it.
