Do you want me to launch the intro?

[Babaloga]
Your clock is one second ahead.

[Loading]
It might be.

[Babaloga]
No, no, my. It's telling me- Time.is is telling me my clock is one second ahead.

[Loading]
Hacc, edit this all out.

[Babaloga]
No, this is the. This is the like-

[Loading]
This is the cold open?

[Babaloga]
-the cold open on us just like, goofing off. And then you kick in the theme music over the intro a little bit in.

[Loading]
And do you want to do the theme music for us? I'm sure you've got a bunch of loose audio files.

[Babaloga]
Uh yeah, I'm sure I can scrounge up something. Just literally like some- some, like, scratch file from something I worked on eight years ago.

[Loading]
Yeah, I think that's the play.

[Babaloga]
That- turn up like an early draft of fuckin' Aurora from 2019. Or whatever.

[Loading]
I think that's a good plan.

(Intro music "AroraFreeWriting5-2.mp3" by Babaloga plays)

[Hacceuee]
Editor's note: that file is called "AroraFreeWriting5-2.mp3", dated February 21st, 2018. It was on my hard drive. It is important to add that aurora is spelled incorrectly. Now back to the program.

(A loud rattling sound can be heard)

[Loading]
So welcome to Babaloading Episode 15.

[Babaloga]
(distantly) Why is it 15?

[Loading]
Episode 15.

[Babaloga]
Okay

[Loading]
Been doing this for 15... years.

[Babaloga]
Yeah. Only one episode a year though so it's not too much work.

[Loading]
Let me- yeah...

[Babaloga]
Loading, I broke my fucking light bulb.

(Rattling stops)

[Loading]
Fuck. Expound on that. Tell me about this broken light bulb.

[Babaloga]
I was trying to screw the light bulb in- so I've got these cheap ass light bulbs in this terrible lampshade. 
(Babaloga grows less distant)
And for some reason, when- If you're not careful- This is the second light bulb this has happened with. If you're not careful while you're screwing in the light bulb, the lampshade, just like, shears it off its base.

[Loading]
Interesting. This seems like a bad lamp.

[Babaloga]
I don't know why... Yeah, it's an Ikea lamp...

[Loading]
Yeah Ikea has never made a good furniture.

[Babaloga]
Well, so... the lamp is designed. You're supposed to put the lamp shade on to the lamp and then screw on another piece, and then screw the light bulb into that. But the lamp shade that I have is not an Ikea lamp shade. And so the other piece doesn't fit over it. And so the only thing holding it in place is the light bulb screwing directly through it into the socket.

[Loading]
So what I'm hearing is this is user error.

[Babaloga]
Well, it's an unwillingness by any of the parties involved to standardize the way that we attach light bulbs to lamps to lamp shades.

[Loading]
Yeah that makes sense. Did we introduce ourselves? Hold on-

[Babaloga]
I'm Baba... loga

[Loading]
I'm Loading, not loga.

[Babaloga]
Hass is here, but refuses to be recorded.

[Loading]
Hass refuses to be recorded because she's a little bitch. Sorry Hass.

[Babaloga]
Woof... I... the views expressed by Loading are not necessarily the views of myself.

[Loading]
Yeah, but Hass might agree with me. We don't know. We could have a two thirds majority.

[Babaloga]
Hass might be actively agreeing with you right now without (indistinct)

[Loading]
That's true. It's sort of a Schrödinger's cat situation right now. You know, Schrodinger-

[Babaloga]
Schrodinger's Hacc, come on. It was literally right there.

[Loading]
But I- you didn't let me finish. I was going to say Schrodinger's little bitch.

[Babaloga]
That's not nearly as good as Schrodinger's Hass though.

[Loading]
That's true.

[Babaloga]
Anyway, I have two broken LED light bulbs now.

[Loading]
Do you want me to fax you one? Where are you streaming from currently?

[Babaloga]
(In a half-assed New York accent)
Brooklyn, New York.

[Loading]
Brooklyn New York, one of the five boroughs.

[Babaloga]
Oh, really? 

[Loading]
Yeah, there's five whole boroughs.

[Babaloga]
I should write that down, I didn't know that.

[Loading]
Yeah.

[Babaloga]
Do you know what the other ones are?

[Loading]
Manhattan. The Bronx. Brooklyn. Long Island.

[Babaloga]
Kentucky and Maine. Right?

[Loading]
Staten island? No.

[Babaloga]
Taste and smell.

[Loading]
Taste and smell. Yeah, that makes sense. I should have those. 

[Babaloga]
Shoulda

[Loading]
They're like the Infinity stones. Once you gather all the boroughs, you can control New York. And, I guess go full Robert Moses and just pave over low income areas.

[Babaloga]
Mm. He did love doing that.

[Loading]
He did. And so do you! That's your plan currently, right? That's what you're working on?

[Babaloga]
Yeah I mean I'm in the Robert Moses school of paving over literally everything in fucking sight.

[Loading]
Yeah that makes sense. That's uh... I mean, I think that's the next logical step for your sort of character arc. You know...

[Babaloga]
Here's the problem Loading is, I- I was in the act of screwing the light bulb back into the lamp so that I could turn the lamp on. And now the lamp is not on, and I don't have a light bulb.

[Loading]
Do you want me to turn my light off in solidarity?

[Babaloga]
 I would appreciate it, yeah.

[Loading]
All right cool, one sec. Let me. All right. We're podcasting in the dark. I'm only illuminated by the large window in my studio.

[Babaloga]
Darkcasting, as they call it.

[Loading]
Darkcasting, podcasting after dark. We're going to get a little saucy in here. Well, that.

[Babaloga]
Well, that wasn't my intention.

[Loading]
You should have thought about that.

[Babaloga]
But I will embrace this new reality. It's all we can do, really? 

[Loading]
It's true.

[Babaloga]
Loading, what's your opinion on pickles?

[Loading]
Pickles are like a Pittsburgh- They're a thing Pittsburgh's very proud of. I'm not wild about them, but it is a cultural thing to an extent, because a Heinz company used to be stationed here in Pittsburgh.

[Babaloga]
And Heinz is known for pickles and not ketchup.

[Loading]
They do both. They're-

[Babaloga]
Yeah, they do both, but they do one way better.

[Loading]
Yeah, but they- we did everything Heinz. We still continue to do everything in Heinz.

[Babaloga]
Yeah but, you know, Hershey Foods does cashews but that doesn't make Hershey, Pennsylvania a cashew town.

[Loading]
No. There's also a big event called Picklesburg, which is a stretch of a... it's a stretch. Pickles burg is a stretch, but it's a big event. People show up for it. It's like a big pickles thing.

[Babaloga]
Yeah

[Loading]
Yeah

[Babaloga]
Anyway

[Loading]
Anyway

[Babaloga]
Have you noticed that people who do like pickles are often militant about this fact?

[Loading]
No.

[Babaloga]
It's. If you don't like pickles and someone does- Listen, I really like tomatoes. I recognize that there are a decent number of people out there who don't like tomatoes, and I don't have to understand it, but I don't have to make it their problem that I don't understand it, you know?

[Loading]
Myself included. I don't like tomatoes.

[Babaloga]
Yeah, see, you're weird, but I would never say that.

[Loading]
We can still be friends!

[Babaloga]
Outside of this extremely specific context. I would just be like: "huh". But if you don't like pickles and you're in the presence of someone who likes pickles, they're gonna flip their shit at you.

[Loading]
That's true. It's- it's a little bit like someone who went to Harvard. You know, they're going to bring up, like, "I love a pickle". You know, it comes up in every conversation I've ever had with someone who likes a pickle. They're real big on it.

[Babaloga]
But y- I don't mind that aspect so much.

[Loading]
No

[Babaloga]
The aspect that I mind is that this behavior also transfers to people who are in the business of serving food.

[Loading]
Mm

[Babaloga]
Where- and you might recognize some of these talking points from a recent conversation on Mechscord- If somebody is serving a dish with pickles in it and you ask for it without pickles, there's better odds than pretty much any other food that they're just going to like outright refuse or ignore that request.

[Loading]
Okay, but if I get like a big sandwich, I need a pickle spear. The pickle spear grounds me and lets me know it's going to be a good sandwich.

[Babaloga]
I recognize that you need that. 

[Loading]
I- I will, my guy-

[Babaloga]
I need to be acknowledged and and, you know, responded to when I communicate that I don't need that. To a restaurant owner.

[Loading]
Here's the thing, though. I might not eat the pickle spear, but it needs to be there. It's symbolic of the quality of the meal. You know, it's a little. It's a garnish, it's important.

[Babaloga]
And you know what? As long as you're not specifically asking for no pickle spear, I have no problem with that happening.

[Loading]
Are you asking for no pickle spear?

[Babaloga]
I'm asking for no pickles whenever pickles are an option, and I get pickles anyway about half the time.

[Loading]
Interesting. It's.

[Babaloga]
I don't know what it is.

[Loading]
I don't know what it is. Maybe we need to delete pickles from the cultural lexicon.

[Babaloga]
The funny thing is, it's not even pickles that I dislike. It's just dill.

[Loading]
Mm, Yeah.

[Babaloga]
Non-dill pickles I- I'm good with.

[Loading]
Do you fuck with a raw cucumber?

[Babaloga]
Hell yeah, cucumbers are great.

[Loading]
I've- This has become one of the many joys of my life. Right. So I go to the grocery store once a week. I get some food. We're going to need to content warning this episode for food.

[Babaloga]
(laughing) What? No, we haven't mentioned food yet.

[Loading]
So I get some food, and then right at the end I go "Mm, a little light on vegetables", circle back to the start of the grocery store, and I grab an entire cucumber, and that's a little snack for me.

[Babaloga]
I'm also in the business of putting entire cucumbers inside myself, but it's a little different.

[Loading]
Expound on that.

[Babaloga]
(clearly across the room again)
I would actually prefer not to. 

[Loading]
We're- we're live right now. We're recording.

[Babaloga]
Well, we are recording. We're not live.

[Loading]
That's true. Hacc, keep this in. Hacc? Keep it in.

[Babaloga]
It is funny, Like the- the- any- any hypothetical listeners would have no way of knowing this, but Hacc has actually been completely silent the entire time.

[Loading]
That's true. Hacc is in this call. Hacc has not been deafened or muted for either of us, I don't believe, and Hacc is dead silent. She may have disconnected her microphone. She may be-

[Babaloga]
I think she's playing Silksong.

[Loading]
She's playing Silksong. That's going to date this episode.

[Babaloga]
I would love to date this episode. (laughs)

[Loading]
So are you kidding me? This episode got everything. It's got pickles. It's got a little bit of cucumber. You know.

[Babaloga]
It can take an entire cucumber.

[Loading]
Can take an- This episode can fit an entire cucumber in it, and just-

[Babaloga]
I think I've, I've come to the conclusion that Hacc is almost certainly not listening.

[Loading]
Yeah. Probably not.

[Babaloga]
I think Hacc has walked away from the computer

[Loading]
Oh, there's a discord message! Hacc has sent us a salute.

[Babaloga]
Well, it breaks the illusion a little bit, but.

[Loading]
It does, it does.

[Babaloga]
I choose to believe what I've already chosen to believe.

[Loading]
Can't believe this... Finally-

[Babaloga]
I can.

[Loading]
-we've made it big. We're podcasters.

[Babaloga]
Pocdacsters.

[Loading]
Is there anything bigger than becoming a professional podcaster? Going pro?

[Babaloga]
Yes. A really good book.

[Loading]
You read any good books?

[Babaloga]
You remember that Vine?

[Loading]
No.

[Babaloga]
Bo Burnham? Nah nevermind. Before your time.

[Loading]
I- No I was a conscientious objector during the Vinh era. Yeah.

[Babaloga]
Yeah.

[Loading]
Yeah.

[Babaloga]
Which is a shame, because the Vine era ruled actually, like-

[Loading]
I've been told that.

[Babaloga]
A lot of that shit's really funny. I have read some good books. I actually moved before I finished the last, or at least the most recent of the Southern Reach books. I never picked it back up, but that's what I was reading most recently.

[Loading]
I've been reading the Selected Works of Ye Song and, Ye Song's "The Wings" because of the Soulmates podcast, who talked about it briefly. Shout out to the Soul Mates podcast, hashtag oatmeal for yaoi doctors, a bit I will not explain. 
(uncomfortable silence)
Yeah. No, I'm really enjoying it. It's like a it's a book of like, Korean modernist poetry, which is really interesting.

[Babaloga]
Hmmm

[Loading]
Yeah.

[Babaloga]
Sounds interesting... I mean you said an interesting thing and then you just sort of spoke gibberish for a little bit about some kind of oatmeal thing, but that's fine. We can edit that out.

[Loading]
No. Yeah. We can, we can edit out oatmeal for yaoi doctors.

[Babaloga]
As long as we don't bring up oatmeal for yaoi doctors again we can edit it out.

[Loading]
That's true. If- if oatmeal for yaoi-

[Babaloga]
As long as we keep oatmeal for yaoi doctors contained within that one thing that you said, then we will be able to edit out oatmeal for yaoi doctors.

[Loading]
Yeah. Hashtag oatmeal for yaoi doctors, that's a bit. But boost it. Post it, get it trending.

[Babaloga]
Don't get it trending. 

[Loading]
Don't get it trending

[Babaloga]
I'm not going to fucking boost some other chucklefuck's hashtag.

[Loading]
I'll boost another chucklefuck's hashtag.

[Babaloga]
What if the game studio Chucklefish notorious for like...

[Loading]
Child labor?

[Babaloga]
Yeah. And all sorts of other sort of workplace abuses and mismanagement was actually called Chucklefuck.

[Loading]
It would make Starbound a better game.

[Babaloga]
Yeah, marginally but I agree because there would be like a moment of of levity every time the logo comes up when you launch the game, like "heh, Chucklefuck".

[Loading]
You ever think about Starbound?

[Babaloga]
Rarely these days.

[Loading]
It should be good. It should be a good game, I think.

[Babaloga]
I don't think I, you know, Starbound was pretty clearly made by people who are big fans of Terraria, and that's just not me. So I don't think I was ever going to like the game as much as I wanted to.

[Loading]
You're not a Terraria guy.

[Babaloga]
You don't sound surprised, but you're sort of saying it as if you expect to be surprised?

[Loading]
I'm not surprised. I'm saying it as a revelatory fact that is unsurprising to me. But it's like a big reveal. And currently we're podcasting. You know.

[Babaloga]
Like, so this is so you're you're revealing to the audience.

[Loading]
I'm revealing to the audience: Babaloga, not a Terraria guy!

[Babaloga]
I- Audience you're going to have to bear with me. I'm- I'm- I'm unsteady in the format. I might make some faux pas. Point out some things that I shouldn't.

[Loading]
Yeah Baba's never listened to a podcast before.

[Babaloga]
I only listen to birdsong and the conversations of strangers with juicy gossip.

[Loading]
What about strangers with, unjuicy gossip?

[Babaloga]
I listen for the purposes of determining the juiciness of the gossip, and then if it's unjuicy, I stop listening.

[Loading]
If it's unjuicy... How do you determine the juice of a gossip as fast as you can? Is there, like, a, there's like a checklist?

[Babaloga]
I mean, that's a it's a lot of it is just instinct. A lot of it is just knowing what to listen for. You know, it's it's sort of like, how could, how does- how does someone who's really into cars know what kind of engine a car is just from the sounds that they hear? Like there's ways, but it's kind of difficult to just put into words.

[Loading]
Yeah. You see, I never learned the skill of juicy gossip. All my gossip is stale.

[Babaloga]
Dry, brittle gossip.

[Loading]
Dry brittle gossip, smashing it on the table like a light bulb.

[Babaloga]
Gossip does kind of sound like it's some kind of liquid confection.

[Loading]
I would drink a gossip.

[Babaloga]
"Oh we've got, we've got several jars of gossip in the basement from last winter's harvest"

[Loading]
Mm-hm, Of course, harvesting the hottest of goss now chilling. Brining the goss.

[Babaloga]
You can- (laughs) You can the gunliper beans into gossip, which is a lovely sweetener with a very strong distinctive flavor.

[Loading]
Tell me, have you had the gossip of last year yet, or are you still only supping on this year's gossip?

[Babaloga]
(laughs) What, why would I wait to have last year's gossip? What was I dr- what was I supping on last year?

[Loading]
(overtop)
Well, we're aging it, we're aging it. It's like a fine wine, you know?

[Babaloga]
But then why am I already supping on this year's gossip?

[Loading]
That's true. Have you- Tell me, have you ever read like, The Picture of Dorian Gray? That's a well aged gossip. Only the best.

[Babaloga]
True. Okay. Yeah. I see where you're going with this.

[Loading]
You see? Yeah.

[Babaloga]
I don't think that's actually gossip though because, and I hate to break this to you Loading, that is a- a work of fiction. Can't believe I'm on the record laughing at that.

[Loading]
Yeah.

[Babaloga]
This is the worst day of my life.

[Loading]
Is it? What was the worst day of your life?

[Babaloga]
Ooh, that's an interesting question. I have a feeling that if I find an answer that I'm satisfied with, I might not necessarily want to share it. But-

[Loading]
Yeah, we're on a podcast right now, and I realized immediately after asking the question, it's a huge fucking downer.

[Babaloga]
But it's- it's definitely a question that like, spurs some thought because I don't know that there's like an immediate, obvious answer for me.

[Loading]
Yeah. Because I feel like there's a low point. And then you there's the moment you realize you've been at a low point.

[Babaloga]
Yeah, I've got like bad periods of my life, right? And I've got like, local, like "that was definitely the worst day for a while before or after".

[Loading]
Mm-hm

[Babaloga]
But I don't know that I would necessarily be able to measure like something that happened two years ago versus something that happened eight years ago, you know?

[Loading]
Yeah. I mean there is an empirical scale for how bad the day is. And I assume you've been logging that in your journal every day.

[Babaloga]
I've got a line-a-day that I've been doing for a little over a year now. Yeah, I think I've got a sufficient data.

[Loading]
You know, the Babaloga scale of how bad a day can be.

[Babaloga]
It sounds like, like a self-help thing. Or maybe like a book of poems.

[Loading]
Yeah. Which leads us into our next segment. Welcome to the marketing Zone. Check out our new book, How Bad the Day Can Be. Now, how bad's your day been? I can't imagine it's very good you're listening to this dog shit podcast. But you know what could be better is if you read our book How Bad the Day Can Be.

[Babaloga]
(laughing) Guaranteed to make your day worse!

[Loading]
Guaranteed to make your day worse. And now here's the thing. Once you days worse, it can only go up from there. You know, we set an artificial low point when you read our book.

[Babaloga]
I don't. Hey, Loading can I pull you aside out of the ad for a second? Yeah, I don't think that's true. Like, we- we can guarantee a reduction in the quality of the reader's day, but I don't think that necessarily means that we will bring it to rock bottom, you know? Oh, I don't want to run afoul of the Better Business Bureau or something.

[Loading]
Baba

[Babaloga]
Or the FTC or whoever's in charge of this shit.

[Loading]
Baba, we've got a run of 50,000 of these books. We got to sell these fuckers.

[Babaloga]
(sighs) We are pretty deep in the hole.

[Loading]
We are pretty deep in the hole. And now you tell me this. You come to me-

[Babaloga]
We read this book, and it put us so deep in debt.

[Loading]
It's so deep, it's self-published.

[Babaloga]
That's why the book makes your day worse, is it puts you so deep in the hole.

[Loading]
The book is really about our journey of spending millions of dollars on this book. And we're so in debt.

[Babaloga]
This book is like The Ring meets a pyramid scheme.

[Loading]
Anyway, we're both on Kofi, so if you want to support us, you don't have to buy the book. You can just toss us money directly and it really helps, you know?

[Babaloga]
I'm not on Kofi.

[Loading]
Neither am I. Well, it's fine. We'll set up a bucket.

[Babaloga]
Was that a Homestuck reference?

[Loading]
No. How would that be a Homestuck reference?

[Babaloga]
I- genuinely I- Well, okay, I do know. I almost lied to you, and I'm sorry about that, Loading, I truly am.

[Loading]
We're 15 episodes into this. We've been at this for 15 years, and you're still fucking lying to me. Where do the lies end?

[Babaloga]
Yeah, it's pathalogical

[Loading]
That's what I fucking thought. All the lies? All of them? What about the ones you tell yourself?

[Babaloga]
Oh, boy, we don't have time to get into that.

[Loading]
We don't have time for that. What is this? Therapy? No. But with our sponsor, BetterHelp, you can get the therapy you don't deserve. I've heard it's quite bad.

[Babaloga]
You can get the therapy that no one deserves.

[Loading]
You get the worst therapy, but it's online.

[Babaloga]
Babaloading productions is proudly sponsored by BetterHelp. We demanded it. We went to them.

[Loading]
We went to them. They're not paying us for this, but we're starting a brand relationship. 

[Babaloga]
We just believe in the company.

[Loading]
We believe- We just like the stock. Oh, God.

[Babaloga]
What if you started, like, an actually good therapy company called WorseHelp.

[Loading]
Expound on that. 

[Babaloga]
No. 

[Loading]
Okay. I think you do have a hard time competing with BetterHelp, but on the other hand, they've done half the work for you.

[Babaloga]
Yeah, you can sort of piggyback.

[Loading]
You can, you can say, "hey teens-"

[Babaloga]
But I feel like the name, the name would present a lot of challenge.

[Loading]
The name would present challenges, but it also, you know, sometimes-

[Babaloga]
(laughing) What if you called it EvenBetterHelp.

[Loading]
They might have that trademarked already. We don't know.

[Babaloga]
I've they definitely have BetterHelp trademarked. I don't think you are allowed to have the name of another company in the name of your company. Like, I couldn't make a company called Cooler Disney.

[Loading]
Okay, but what if it's Even Bedder Help with Ds instead of Ts.

[Babaloga]
B- (laughing) "Bedder"?

[Loading]
Bedder help? Yeah.

[Babaloga]
Bedder help.

[Loading]
We send you-

[Babaloga]
And "Help" has an extra E on the end.

[Loading]
Yeah, I think this plan has legs. I think we got it.

[Babaloga]
And then if they try to challenge us in court, I'm like, no, no, it's named after my great grandfather Bedder Helpe.

[Loading]
Bedder Loga.

[Babaloga]
Bedder Loga. Bedder Loga, bedder pizza.

[Loading]
Bedder Loga, bedder pizza. Now is the "better" for the pizza spelled with D's? Is that pizza the size of a bed?

[Babaloga]
BEDder pizza.

[Loading]
BEDder pi-

[Babaloga]
Bed or Pizza?

[Loading]
Bad or pizza? Welcome to our new game show. Bed or pizza?

[Babaloga]
Oh see, I was thinking it was like a bed and breakfast.

[Loading]
It's-

[Babaloga]
but it's a "bed or pizza".

[Loading]
It's "Is it cake?" But it's- it's one of these two things.

[Babaloga]
You- You show up to my quaint little cottage. You can buy a room for the night. You can buy a delicious slice of pizza. You cannot do both.

[Loading]
That's true. Will you be in the- Will you be in the room for the night? Is this one night of passion with Babaloga?

[Babaloga]
That's not one of the advertised services, but I'm, you know, available to negotiate.

[Loading]
You know? Yeah. No, you're your own person. You know, you're open to your own seductions and whatnot.

[Babaloga]
Yeah. It's listen, it's not it's not part of the business plan. But I'm not going to explicitly tell you that there's like an economic or ethical constraint that would prevent that from happenning.

[Loading]
Anyway we're leaving the marketing department.
(laughs)

[Babaloga]
(laughing)
Oh yeah. Thanks to all our sponsors.

[Loading]
Thanks to our sponsors BetterHelp and fuckin'... our book. Go buy our book. I don't remember the name of- oh "The Worst Days" is that what it was called?

[Babaloga]
How Bad Can A Day Be?

[Loading]
How Bad Can A Day Be, our YA...

[Babaloga]
Something like that.

[Loading]
Our YA novel.

[Babaloga]
I don't know. Audience go back and scrub through and come back here and tell us

[Loading]
Yeah, okay. But what do you do that I'm also listen back to the rest of the marketing department.

[Babaloga]
No, Loading, we have to give them a chance to speak, otherwise we won't know. All right.

[Loading]
Oh yeah.

[Babaloga]
So go ahead and tell us now you went back. Go ahead and tell us what it was.

[Loading]
Mm-hm, and you can ping babble logo directly on discord.

[Babaloga]
No, I- we're listening right now Loading!

[Loading]
Oh, sorry, I was listening.

(You tell Babaloga and Loading that the book was titled "How Bad The Day Can Be")

[Babaloga]
Oh okay. That's right. That's what it was. All right gotcha.

[Loading]
Ohhh, You see, I thought it was the other thing, but-

[Babaloga]
Yeah.

[Loading]
-look at me.

[Babaloga]
Well, thanks for- thanks for going back and checking that. I do appreciate it.

[Loading]
Yeah. Marketing over. We are doney with the funny.

[Babaloga]
We are doney with the money.

[Loading]
We are doney with the money. Fuck, that would have been good.

[Babaloga]
Yeah, that would wouldn't it?

[Loading]
We're doney with the money. That's better than marketing department. Fuck.

[Babaloga]
Well you can't say it going into marketing department... because you're not yet. Doney with the money.

[Loading]
Well, no. We say we've beguney with the money. Okay. Yeah. Now, this this has got this big money with the money. 

[Babaloga]
Okay yeah. Yeah no this- this is good. This works.

[Loading]
We've beguney with the money! You sort of have a cloak, you sweep it over it. You say "We've Beguney!". 

[Babaloga]
"The money has beguney"

[Loading]
"The money has beguney"

[Babaloga]
"And now all will tremble in fear."

[Loading]
"For the return of the money! we love"

[Babaloga]
(yawns)
So did you bring something that you wanted to... that- Did you have a subject that you wanted to speak on in this episode?

[Loading]
I think we spoke on it. I think we plugged our book. We talked about a light bulb. You talked about pickles.

[Babaloga]
I did talk about pickels.

[Loading]
That's true. I've been walking to work all year. That's been a delight.

[Babaloga]
I- you know what? When I started walking to work, a huge improvement to my life.

[Loading]
Huge improvement. You don't even work! You're homeless!

[Babaloga]
Welll I- I don't now, but I did work-

[Loading]
On the streets of New York!

[Babaloga]
My- my- my bed or pizza that I run out of my eighth story apartment.

[Loading]
(laughing)
Your studio apartment.

[Babaloga]
Yeah. That's why it's a bed or pizza. Because if someone's in here eating pizza, the bed is not available to use.

[Loading]
Can you sleep on the pizza?

[Babaloga]
Physically? Yes. Legally? Yes. Morally? Yes. I wouldn't advise it.

[Loading]
Okay, let's change it up-

[Babaloga]
It's a pizza. It's not going to be pleasant.

[Loading]
What if we swap out the pizza for a calzone?

[Babaloga]
It's an improvement.

[Loading]
It's an improvement.

[Babaloga]
It's not nearly as much of an improvement as you would want it. But yeah, like genuinely back when I had a job that I would drive to on the dailies, just switching from driving to work to taking the Metro, I (weird cut) the walk. You know, in the summer, I might be considered by some to be one of the Sweatier boys alive, and that definitely was a problem in the summer.

[Loading]
Mm-hm

[Babaloga]
But still better than fucking 40 minutes of traffic in the evening. There's just- it grinds on your brain. It's- it's awful.

[Loading]
It's- I could hypothetically I could drive five minutes or I could walk 30. I'll take the walk 30. Just because it's so nice to just have that time to think and walk and just be active like it's good.

[Babaloga]
Yeah. I mean, as as Kurt Vonnegut said, we are dancing animals.

[Loading]
Did he say that?

[Babaloga]
He did, yeah

[Loading]
Man, this Kurt Vonnegut guy's-

[Babaloga]
You're expecting a joke here. But that's just a true thing. It's part of a larger thing that he wrote, I don't know what specific form it was. It was like an essay or a statement or what.

[Loading]
But all I know is that Kurt Vonnegut thought of-

[Babaloga]
The ice that fucking kill you?

[Loading]
Yeah, ice that kills you, the ice that kills everyone.

[Babaloga]
He did think of that. And he was also like, what if slaughterhouses? But there was five of them. Would that be fucked up or what?

[Loading]
Well, I learned about the ice thing because of the game Zero Escape, which will in the same breath tell you about ice nine and then explain to you how the Titanic didn't actually sink. One of the wilder gaming experiences I've had in my life.

[Babaloga]
I'm not familiar.

[Loading]
It's like a point and click adventure sort of style game, where the main love interest explains to you that the Titanic didn't sink, Yeah.

[Babaloga]
The Titanic didn't think it just went home?

[Loading]
No, the Titanic didn't sink. The Lusitania sank. You could learn all about it in the podcast that we didn't do: Did Titanic sink?

[Babaloga]
I mean, the Lusitania also sunk.

[Loading]
Or, not The Lusitania. Fuckin'... the Olympic? I think it's called the Olympic.

[Babaloga]
Okay, so there was a switcheroo.

[Loading]
There's a switcheroo, yeah.

[Babaloga]
Okay, that's fun.

[Loading]
Well, it's they sort of, The Parent Trap'd it.

[Babaloga]
I mean, okay, is The Parent Trap not a switcheroo?

[Loading]
The Parent Trap's a switcheroo, yeah. Like how- Like, it's like the Titanic and the Olympic.

[Babaloga]
What are what are we talking about here, then? It sounds like they did a switcheroo.

[Loading]
They did do a switcheroo. But they also one of them had to get, like, their ears pierced and stuff. It was a whole thing. You're right.

[Babaloga]
"Oh they didn't do a switcheroo, they did A Prince and the Pauper."

[Loading]
You. Yeah. You remember in The Parent Trap there's that scene where the one girl pierces the other girls ear, like in a fucking, you know, cabin at camp?

[Babaloga]
Mary Kate pierces Ashley's ear, and then Ashley hits an iceberg and dooms hundreds to die at sea.

[Loading]
Yeah, I love that part. It's such a great movie. Well.

[Babaloga]
That's why you don't pierce your ocean liners.

[Loading]
That's true.

[Babaloga]
They need to be intact in order to function.

[Loading]
That's true.

[Babaloga]
Thanks for listening to "Well There's Your Problem".

[Loading]
Thanks for listening to "Well There's Your Problem" hosted by Loading and Babaloga.

[Babaloga]
Guest hosts. They should let us on. I've listened to one entire episode of that podcast.

[Loading]
I didn't know this was a real podcast.

[Babaloga]
Yeah, exactly. They should let us guest host it.

[Loading]
I think we should start nudging other small podcasts just to see how many we can get on as guests.

[Babaloga]
That's a small enough podcast that, if we like, lied about it, and made ourselves seem like a larger podcast than we were and ask them to be guests on, we might be able to get them.

[Loading]
I think we could get on the On the Talkers' podcast Infinite Cities.

[Babaloga]
Yeah, probably. I mean, we're like running in the same circle.

[Loading]
We're in the same circles. Yeah.

[Babaloga]
I think I mean, I don't honestly, I don't know if we'd be able to, but like, I guess it seems more likely than literally any other podcast on earth.

[Loading]
I got onto it once. It was a whole thing.

[Babaloga]
Yeah I believe that. You were- You hosted-

[Loading]
The Slammin Cup

[Babaloga]
Slammin- yes, exactly.

[Loading]
I didn't host it. I was I was one of the best couple. But you.

[Babaloga]
Were a host of it.

[Loading]
I was a host. Yeah.

[Babaloga]
That means you hosted it.

[Loading]
That's true, I was known for doing a certain ad.

[Babaloga]
Yeah, it was an ad for our book, right?

[Loading]
Yeah. An ad for a book. It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. Our book: Pick It Up our YA fantasy novel.

[Babaloga]
Our YA Ska French Revolution book. It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. Our book. Pick it up.

[Loading]
Our book. It's a real book. Find it in Barnes and Noble near you.

[Babaloga]
I left it on the floor.

[Loading]
I left it on the floor.

[Babaloga]
Find it at a Barnes and Noble near you as long as you're also near me.

[Loading]
As long as you are also in Pittsburgh or New York. That's right. There's two of them.

[Babaloga]
The books do not match.

[Loading]
The books do not match. No.

[Babaloga]
We just didn't coordinate. Independently wrote books, gave them the same title and left them in different Barnes and Nobles.

[Loading]
We had to cut a lot of controversial content in them. So one of them's a little spicier than the out there.

[Babaloga]
Yeah, Loading's manifesto was like a good portion of the length of the book, and we had to cut most of that out. So it's actually only about 11 pages now.

[Loading]
Yeah. So one of them is what like 215? The other one's 11. You'll know which one you get pretty quick.

[Babaloga]
If it's more of a pamphlet, that's the latest revision. Loading I have an abrupt change of topic.

[Loading]
Yeah, go for it.

[Babaloga]
Are you familiar with the game Slave of God?

[Loading]
Which one? I know Jacob Geller talked about it.

[Babaloga]
That's- yes! Okay. Yeah. I didn't recognize it by name. I was assigned it for one of my many classes.

[Loading]
He talks about that in his, Games that are not games video, right?

[Babaloga]
I think it might be the museums one, which I think is the same one, right? Or it might be the Art for Nobody one. It's a game that very much seems like it doesn't want you to be playing it. I didn't recognize it by title, but as soon as I got in there, I was like, oh, Jacob Geller talked about this, I'm pretty sure.

[Babaloga]
And it's- listen, like it's not a good time as like a sensory experience. And for the listeners out there, anyone with even a hint of photosensitivity should stay as far away from this game as they possibly can. But it's a deeply fascinating experience because it is so abnormal. It's so unique in what it does, and it's so resists easy interaction.

[Babaloga]
It's difficult to even parse what you're looking at. Always. There is not a frame of this game that it's easy to tell what's going on. There doesn't just look like a mash of random colors. There's something fascinating about that, and I honestly never thought that I would be the kind of person who likes weird art just because it's weird.

[Babaloga]
Like, I remember thinking that that was pretentious, you know, a long time ago. Now it's, oh, shit, this is weird and interesting and different, and I love it purely on that basis.

[Loading]
Maybe you're becoming pretentious.

[Babaloga]
I mean, almost certainly. Right? But like-

[Loading]
You and your big city New York schoolin'.

[Babaloga]
I think you can't interact with something deeply- You can't pay deep attention to something for very long without becoming a little bit pretentious about it.

[Loading]
I think that's fair.

[Babaloga]
Because novelty starts to become way more appealing than quality.

[Loading]
So what game are you playing next Baba?

[Babaloga]
If you haven't played Kentucky Route Zero, you absolutely must.

[Loading]
How long is that?

[Babaloga]
It's decently long. I think you'll know within the first like chapter whether you're into it and the first chapter is less than an hour.

[Loading]
I will trade you...

[Babaloga]
And if there's like nothing in that first chapter that appeals to you. Then don't even bother with the rest of it.

[Loading]
I will trade you with: finish Sword of the Sea.

[Babaloga]
Okay here's the problem-

[Loading]
Here's the problem?

[Babaloga]
-is that's probably a fair trade, although I'm sure finishing Sword of the Sea is going to be a much longer thing than playing the first chapter of Kentucky Route Zero. But also I have a bunch of other shit that I need to play...

[Loading]
No that's fair.

[Babaloga]
...in the next week.

[Loading]
What are you playing this next week?

[Babaloga]
Pull up the list... Umurangi Generation is the required one.

[Loading]
Oh I've- I've heard that one is quite good.

[Babaloga]
Yes, it looked really interesting when I saw it. And honestly, the fact that it's being assigned in the same breath as Kentucky Route Zero and Slave of God, both of which I found utterly fascinating, I'm more than willing to play every single one of these.

[Loading]
Disco Elysium on the rubric?

[Babaloga]
It's been mentioned a few times. I have not seen it on the rubric yet, but it's also one of those games that pretty much everyone there has...

[Loading]
Yeah.

[Babaloga]
...you know, at least knows about?

[Loading]
You've- you've already played it right?

[Babaloga]
It's like Outer Wilds. I was actually kind of surprised that Kentucky Route Zero wasn't in that category. Most of the people there hadn't heard of it, which is wild to me because it's fucking Kentucky Route Zero.

[Babaloga]
Yeah, this game slaps ass all the way up and down the street. How it has not every single person in game school played it.

[Loading]
Yeah, you've played Disco Elysium right?

[Babaloga]
I have, I always sort of fizzle out on it.

[Loading]
Interesting. I really clicked with it.

[Babaloga]
I think there's like a weird, very finicky, very low level friction in just the way that it's got narration and text.

[Loading]
Yeah. 

[Babaloga]
And I always sort of feel like I have to wait for the narration to finish even if I've finished reading the text and then that, just like weird, disjointed pacing, makes it a little bit exhausting to play.

[Loading]
I played Disco Elysium before it had voice acting, which is a different experience, I'll give you that. But I've also-

[Babaloga]
Yeah see that's- Okay, okay, when I started playing it, I asked, was the voice acting in it originally or was that a special edition later thing? Because if it wasn't in the original product, I want to turn it off. And the reaction that I got on Mechscord was like, "you absolutely can't turn off the voice acting. It's core to the experience".

[Babaloga]
And I was like, "okay".

[Loading]
No. The voice acting is very good for certain voices, but it's not core, you know? Like for the lizard brain I think it adds a lot. For the karaoke segment specifically, I think it's important. Did you do the karaoke when you played?

[Babaloga]
I remember the set up for it. Let's see. I can tell you exactly what I have done in that game because it's not a very long list. I, I've talked to the union guy. I've gotten that far in that thing. I've died to his stupid chair.

[Loading]
Yeah, I think that's a rite of passage.

[Babaloga]
Yeah. And I had not saved for, like an hour.

[Loading]
Yeah. It does that. 

[Babaloga]
So uh- yeah see, like, everyone's like, "oh yeah Disco Elysium is so great. And how how do you fizzle out on a game like that?" And then it's, oh you know, it didn't autosave and ate an hour of progress to a joke about a bad chair, and it's "Yeah, yeah it does that".

[Loading]
But I once lost our progress in that game to bugging out in the cut scene, so I didn't get control back and it softlocked the game.

[Babaloga]
Yeah, I by no means think it's a bad game. Me bouncing off of it twice is not an indictment of the game itself. It's just that I have a very hard time engaging with it, which kind of sucks because, like, I know that it's a great game. And I sort of wish that I had a better time with it.

[Loading]
Yeah.

[Babaloga]
But, you know, people talk about having a bad time with Tunic and all of these other games that I really love, and that's just... how it is.

[Loading]
Yeah, it's just not every game has to be for everyone.

[Babaloga]
Yeah, yeah. Exactly. Exactly.

[Loading]
Well, next week we'll talk about our religious experiences with games more. Anything you want to plug?

[Babaloga]
Catholicism.

[Loading]
Yeah. I'd like to particularly plug uh,

(Extended silence)

[Loading]
Nothing.

[Babaloga]
(laughing)
Okay. 

[Loading]
Thank you. Fuck you. Goodbye.
