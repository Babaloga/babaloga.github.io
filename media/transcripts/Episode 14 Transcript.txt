Loading: I'm gonna do the cold open
Triangle: Oh, cold open! 
Okay.
Babaloga: Hang on. I got a, Hey, I got a cold open for you. [Can opening noises]
Loading: Are you gonna be polite and shut the fuck up?
Babaloga: I already did my joke.
Loading: Abruptly, the beggar bends his shaking body and throws a stone into my hat. I have already fainted. I see a map showing my heart migrating into my skull. A cold hand touches my forehead. My forehead is branded with the cold hand’s mark. It will not fade until some time. 
Oh, hi. I didn't see you there. Welcome to the Babaloading Podcast. We've rebranded on this: our 14th episode to "Don't Listen To This Podcast," I think it's called?
Babaloga: Mm-hmm. 
And, no, it's just "Don't listen to this".
Loading: "Don't Listen to this." I'm your host, Loading. Joining me here today is... 
[Awkward silence that lasts literally 2.6s but Hacceuee cut it down to 1.0s for your listening pleasure]
Babaloga: Am I allowed to talk now? 
Loading: Yeah.
Triangle: Oh wait, are we, are we supposed to introduce ourselves now? Who's going first? 
Babaloga: It was, it was not clear when the cold open ended and the podcast began.
Loading: Baba, introduce yourself! 
Babaloga: Uh, okay. Hi, I'm ba uh, ba uh, uh, Babaloga, and we have a very special guest today.
Loading: [Interrupting] Tri! - Shut up - Tri, introduce yourself. 
Triangle: It's me! It's me, Triangle. I'm here. 
Loading: Tri, you're here. Tell us, how's a busy mom keep himself occupied on these long, lonesome nights?
Triangle: You know, it's really easy to keep yourself occupied when you're a parent 'cause your children are always doing something. 
Babaloga: So are we out of the cold open? Was the "shut up" just you genuinely being rude?
Loading: Yeah. 
We're outta the cold open. 
Triangle: The, the only part of the cold open was just reading, reading the poetry, and that was it. 
Babaloga: Imagine asking someone to do a podcast with you and then they start talking in the podcast and you're like, no, shut up.
Loading: I needed you to say, "I'm Babaloga" and then I was gonna roll in with Tri, and it would've been really clean, but you ff- 
Babaloga: I had a great joke plan where I was like, and here we have a, a very special guest today. It's, uh, Esoteric Tr-Tringle? Am I saying that right? Like, I can't pronounce - like I don't know how to pronounce Triangle.
Triangle: That is - that is really good, that is really good, yeah. 
Loading: That would've a good one, yeah... 
Babaloga: Yeah, it would've, but somebody in the call yelled at me to shut up. So. 
Triangle: No, see, think all perfect though 'cause the, the uncoordination just, tell, tells us what's going on here. 
Loading: We got the joke in now. 
Babaloga: This is extremely the vibe, I guess.
Triangle: Yeah. Uh-huh, I mean, it literally fits into the title of this podcast. 
Babaloga: Yeah. [Chewing noises] Why are you here? I'm literally eating a sandwich.
Loading: You came here to talk to us about something very near dear and important to you. What is it? 
Triangle: Um, you know, I came here to talk about the concept of the color orange. 
Loading: Mm-hmm. 
Triangle: …and I think everybody should make sure that they spend some time every day just thinking about the color, because it's really hard to be mad or upset when there's the color orange to think about.
Loading: I disagree. 
Triangle: Do you mean t-thinking of the color orange makes you mad?
Loading: Thinking of the color orange fills me with an irrational rage. 
Triangle: That's really interesting. Now, now - 
Loading: Yeah. 
Triangle: - as a follow-up question, does it make you happy to be full rage? 
Loading: No. Dumb question. Next question. 
Triangle: You know, I think you're - you're ruining my whole idea here. Like my - my hypothesis and thesis is just completely destroyed now.
Loading: I think I am, yeah. 
Babaloga: Yeah. Hey, Loading. Can I pull you aside for a second? 
Loading: Yeah. 
Babaloga: Did we invite this guy on the podcast just to shit on his thesis, like…
Loading: I think so - yeah. That was, was that not your plan? 
Babaloga: I'm, you know, we really should have coordinated this.
Loading: We should have coordinated on this. 
Babaloga: I, I had a, a full glazing plan [laughs]
Loading: He's a married man, Baba, that's not quite appropriate.
Babaloga: Glazed orange is a really nice color for like, pottery to be.
Loading: It is. It's a good color.
Babaloga: Also, it sounds like it would be a good flavor of donut. 
Loading: Baba, I need you to fill a few, like a minute ‘cause in 45 seconds an alarm is about to go off on my phone. 
Babaloga: This is the laundry.
Loading: This is the laundry.
Babaloga: [Laughs] I love how we changed the title of the podcast and we are immediately living up to the title.
Triangle: It's - it's true. Literally the ideal. Literally. 
Loading: It could be worse. I'm about to get interrupted by an anecdote [pronounced antidote]. There's an episode of the Auntie Donna podcast where it's 30 minutes long. The entire time they play the intro music. That's actually more unlistenable than this, I think. 
Triangle: I was gonna say - just nonstop the intro music, which is probably a pretty short clip, right? 
Loading: Yeah, the intro - 'cause they normally talk over it for their intro and it's just 30 minutes of not stopping the intro song. It is unlistenable, it is maybe their worst episode. 
Babaloga: That's, that's a pretty good bit.
Loading: Uh, now if you'll excuse me, laundry time. Guys, fill dead air. 
Babaloga: Ugh.
Triangle: Dead air. Have you ever found air that was actually dead? 
Babaloga: I don't think you can find such air on earth. 
Triangle: That's what I was gonna say. Like, is, is, is there dead air? Because isn't, isn't air generally considered to be able to sustain some sort of life? Like generally things need air. 
Babaloga: Yeah, I think there's - there's little, there's little guys in it all the time. Air - air's full of little guys. That's what they don't teach you at Harvard Business School.
Triangle: Well, they don't want you to know about those 'cause the… you can't sell anything to those guys.
Babaloga: Well, also, it's just really scary… because it's like you can't see 'em, but they're there - 
Triangle: They're there. 
Babaloga: - And they're, they're just really little. That's pretty scary. I know. I'm scared.
Triangle: Just little teeny tiny guys. I don't know.
Babaloga: Little teeny tiny guys.
Triangle: I think - I think tiny - tiny small guys are usually friends though. Right? Isn't, isn't that like, oh, it's just a small little guy.
Babaloga: Someone hasn't played a Pikmin game.
Triangle: No, no. I think -
Babaloga: Those tiny guys are so violent. They kill most of the animals that show up on screen.
Triangle: Yeah, and, and they're so friendly while they do it, though.
Babaloga: I guess… that's a good… point.
Loading: I am back.
Triangle: Loading, what do you feel about small, tiny guys? Friends? Foes?
Loading: Now is this guys or Guys™?
Triangle: Guys. 
Babaloga: Uh, this is generic store brand guys, not the trademark.
Triangle: Yeah, generic small guys. Yeah.
Loading: Generally positive.
Babaloga: Wow. I can't believe you threw me under the bus like this.
Loading: Is there more here or are you just generating dead air? 
Babaloga: Generating dead air is very difficult, as we just established.
Triangle: Yeah, we - we - that was - the whole start of - of this discussion was how it's very hard to have dead air, 'cause there's always little guys in it.
Babaloga: But actually before we, before we get too deep into this, I do have some housekeeping. So you regular listeners might notice that the last week we put out episode 15, and this is episode 14. We looked at our backlog and we realized that we never actually did episode 14. So we're just sort of doubling back and getting that one out of the way.
Triangle: You've just gotta make sure the numbers all work. If you, if you miss a number - 
Babaloga: Yeah.
Triangle: - you can fix it. 
Babaloga: Yeah.
Loading: Yeah.
Triangle: It's like balancing, it's like balancing a spreadsheet. 
Loading: And keen-eared viewers would - keen-eared view...
Oh, my God. Keen-eared viewers would know that we are doing episode 14, because they would've recognized that the beginning I was reading the selected works of Yi Sang, uh, poem number 14, uh…
Triangle: As soon as they hear that, they know "oh this is episode 14." 
Loading: Yeah, you know, this is the selected works of Yi Sang poem number 14.
Babaloga: Right. I see, I see. And by, I see. I mean, I hear, um - 
Loading: You do hear. 
Babaloga: - I guess the, the alternative - which definitely doesn't work with that being poem number 14, so we would have to maybe move some things around - is that we could retroactively, because we realized we skipped 14 - we could make the previous one 14 and just this one will be 15.
Triangle: No. No no no no. That’s not honest. 
Babaloga: Yeah, that's true.
Triangle: You gotta, you gotta keep everything nice and tidy.
Loading: Poem number 15 is my favorite poem in that book.
Triangle: So you're saying we missed our - we missed our opportunity to do 15, so maybe we should have two 15s? 
Loading: I could, we can read that one. 
Babaloga: Should we just scrap this episode and start over?
Loading: No, I have to be on a- a normal phone call with my brother because I love him in an hour. So we don't have time for that.
Babaloga: An hour? We can't record a podcast in an hour. That's such a short amount of time. We're gonna, we're gonna be depriving our viewers of such quality content as everything that has already happened in this episode.
Loading: Let's be real - this episode is going to be edited to 30 minutes. Hass is going to trim some fat. 
Babaloga: What we have already could probably be edited into 30 seconds to a minute of listenable content. 
Loading: I think the cold open was pretty good - I think - 
Triangle: The cold open was great, excellent. 
Babaloga: If you… if you, must include the cold open, I think we might be able to hit 45 seconds. 
Triangle: 45 seconds of good content. 
Loading: There's a lot of chaff that's going to be cut here right up top. And I think Hass knows that. And I think I know that. 
Babaloga: Uh, listeners, we are - or at least, I am about 10 minutes and 30 seconds into the recording –
Loading: - into the recording – 
Babaloga: - so that's a good, that's a good sort of barometer for how much had to be cut out. 
Loading: And let's be real - not cut out was too good to air. We're cutting out, like, dead air, uh… Hass might have cut the laundry arc? 
Triangle: No, we already - we already proved there isn't - there isn't dead air. We – we… there's always little guys. 
Loading: Hass might've cut that out. 
Babaloga: Ugh. Hass cut out all of the little guys and made the air dead. 
Triangle: That's how you get dead air! By cutting out all the lil guys! 
Babaloga: - is by cutting out the little guys. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. 
Loading: Hass, cut this.
Babaloga: [Laughs] Cut none of this! I hope we are exactly 11 minutes and 6 seconds into the podcast right now. 
Triangle: Wouldn't that be ideal? 
Loading: You also do have a few seconds more recording than I do. 
Triangle: It's all fixable in the, in, in post.
Babaloga: Yeah. It's crazy what you can do with AI these days. 
Triangle: Hass - Hass - no, it's Hass, it's not even AI! Hass is a wizard. 
Loading: What makes you think Hass is made of flesh?
Babaloga: Well, Hass - Hass is a huge proponent of, of Generative AI [Baba lies]. You can't hear her right now, but she's agreeing vocally with me [He continues to lie]. As I say that, uh, 
[Silence as Hass yells as Baba over Discord]
[Laughter]
I'm gonna, I'm going to keep referring back to it throughout the podcast.
Loading: Yeah we're going to keep circling back to the fact that you're a huge proponent of generative AI. Hass, keep this in.
Triangle: And Hass is gonna have to do so much extra cutting out now. 
Babaloga: The, the people of Mechscord will know if you cut this out; I will make a stink about it.
[Silence as Hass responds] 
I hope, actually, I hope you include this section in where they can hear us, but not you. That would be really funny. Or it wouldn't, I don't know. 
Loading: Baba. 
Babaloga: Yeah, what? 
Loading: I believe you have a pre-prepared bit for us? 
Babaloga: Ah, shit. Okay, so the, the premise here is, uh, that I read you, 
Loading: Do you have a name for the bit? 
Babaloga: Um, D-... uh… North Dakota Williams, fuck, I don't, I'm sorry. 
Loading: North Dakota Williams is the name of this bit. 
Triangle: I love that name! I think, I think I'm gonna name my next kid North Dakota Williams. 
To be clear, North and Dakota are two of the names. It's a three - it's a three-name name.
Babaloga: Mmmm. North Williams is actually a pretty good name. Like… that sounds like a cool guy. 
Loading: I will say - it doesn't fit with the vibe of your other two children's names. 
Triangle: No! It'll be perfect, it'll be perfect. 
Loading: You're really cultivating a vibe and North Dakota Williams is sorta...
Triangle: No, nobody’s going to question it at all. It’ll be fine. 
Babaloga: So I was gonna say that North Dakota Williams kind of sounds like an off-brand Indiana Jones, but honestly, Tennessee Williams sounds like an off-brand Indiana Jones. 
Loading: Alright, what's the bit?
Babaloga: That's what this segment is about, ladies and gentlemen and others. Tennessee Williams, beloved playwright, or at least notable playwright, has some plays with some titles.
I genuinely don't remember where this came from, but I think the premise is that I'm gonna read out the titles and Loading and maybe Tri, depending on Tri's familiarity with the works… uh, they're gonna try and guess the plot and then I'll tell 'em if they're right.
Triangle: Ooh I love that. Uh huh. 
Babaloga: And so we'll start with an easy one.
Uh, and if you know the plot, don't answer. But Loading has confided in me, in confidence, that he does not know the plot of this very famous work of American literature: A Streetcar Named Desire.
Loading: Now I did tell that during confession, so... 
Babaloga: Yeah. I am also an ordained Catholic priest. 
Triangle: Oh, are - are confessions not safe? Noted. 
Babaloga: Yeah. That's – [Laughing] Where do you, where do you think the Inquisition gets their information? Come on.
Triangle: Oh!
Loading: That's true. 
Alright. Streetcar Named Desire... 
Triangle: Now this is great because I don’t - I don't actually know the plot of this either, so I think, I think together we can, we can work it out. 
Loading: Ok, the year is 1928. T- the location. Desire, North Dakota. 
Triangle: Oh, Desire, North Dakota, okay... 
Loading: Desire, North Dakota! 
Babaloga: Now, you're not allowed to change anything you've already established, but I am gonna give you some feedback. You are about as far as you could possibly be from the actual setting of this place if you assume that it's the continental U.S.
Triangle: Well, I was gonna say - if it's about a streetcar... and, you desire it... where - where would you desire a streetcar but in the United States where you don't have one?
Loading: Desire, North Dakota 
Babaloga: I guess - well, presumably in a, in a town without one. 
Loading: Yeah, in Desire, North Dakota, there are zero street cars. But there's a street!
Triangle: Uh-huh.
Loading: Ripe for the car-en-ing!
And in comes one day, a spunky little car! 
Triangle: A streetcar, even? 
Loading: A street car! A car from and for the streets! 
Triangle: Now, wait, Loading – just - just a really quick question , um - street car, y-you - what is a street car?
Loading: It's like a normal car but it's for the street; it's old-timey. 
Babaloga: [Chewing] Loading, let's set jokes aside for a second. 
Loading: Yeah. 
Babaloga: You do know what a streetcar is in real life, right?
Loading: What is a streetcar? 
Triangle: It's - it's like a trolley. 
Loading: Oh! 
Babaloga: This is the most American thing that Loading has ever said. 
Loading: The fuck is a streetcar! 
Triangle: I love this. This is delightful. You get to learn something new! It's wonderful. They're like trolleys and often times they're even on a little railroad in the middle of the street. Where it's like a fixed spot where it's just gonna always take and so all the other cars have to drive around it. 
Babaloga: San Francisco is famous for having them. 
Triangle: Yeah! San Francisco is a great example. 
Loading: Pittsburgh had a famous trolley system! I know what a trolley looks like!
Babaloga: Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Street car. It's the same thing. 
Triangle: Yeah but a - a streetcar is often on rails. 
Loading: Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood was filmed here! There was a trolley in that. I know what a trolley is!
Babaloga: I wanna, say for the record, I did not mean to laugh at you for not knowing something. I was just very caught off guard. 
Loading: Yeah. 
Babaloga: And it's a little bit funny that you, as an American, didn't know what a streetcar was.
Loading: This would have changed my entire answer... a spunky little streetcar comes to town. 
Babaloga: Mm-hmm. 
Loading: And there's one rail in the middle of town. What do they do on that street car? Think about things. They desire them.
Babaloga: Oh, I thought the answer was gonna be they fuck on it. 
Loading: Baba, I'm going to pull you aside, Baba? 
Babaloga: Yeah. We actually, we are getting, we are getting a great note from the studio that – that there's only a single rail, that would make it a monorail streetcar, which as far as I know, does not exist. 
Triangle: Monorail streetcar is very good actually. 
Loading: Monorail streetcar...
Babaloga: A streetcar named Monorail. 
Loading: Streetcar named Monorail. So, how close were we? 
Triangle: Is it like a romcom or something? Actually, I - I literally have no idea.
Babaloga: No, I, I believe it's a story about like…
Loading: You don't have the plot on hand? 
Babaloga: Well I've, I'm looking at the Wikipedia page, but I'm not just gonna read the plot summary. It's like about loss…and I think maybe there's domestic violence in it. 
Triangle: So to be - to be clear, you have not seen it either. And we're, we're being quizzed and all of us are unfamiliar?
Babaloga: I haven't seen it, but I'm familiar with - 
Triangle: No, I love this! 
Babaloga: I've seen the episode of the Simpsons in which Marge is acting in a Streetcar Named Desire musical. 
Triangle: Oh, that's very good. 
Babaloga: And so that's sort of my exposure to it.
Loading: Alright, what's the next story? 
Babaloga: Uh, all right, let me scroll down through the list. Find one with a fun sounding name and probably very not fun plot. 
Triangle: Uh, is that, is a theme is that - that most are going to be sad? 
Babaloga: I genuinely don't know. I dunno. 
Triangle: Perfect. 
Babaloga: Um, the only difference between me and you is that I'm on this side of the Wikipedia article.
Triangle: Ya know, I think I think is pretty ideal then. I think this is perfect all around.
Loading: I think this good. I think this is good podcasting. 
Babaloga: I like to imagine that someone listening is very familiar with the works of Tennessee Williams. 
Triangle: And just flipping out about this? Yeah. 
Babaloga: Yeah.
Loading: We're gonna get a bunch of messages from Cheshire, like, I can't believe you guys disrespected the great work of Tennessee Williams. 
Babaloga: Okay. How about… 
Ooh, Dragon Country. 
Loading: Dragon Country? Is this one bad?
Babaloga: Well, okay. Okay, so here's the problem is all of the Tennessee Williams plays with the most fun names are the most horrifying. 
Triangle: [In unison with Loading] The worst ones, uh-huh.
Loading: The worst ones. 
Triangle: I am not surprised at all. 
Loading: We've come up with an upsetting and bad bit, I think is what happened here.
Babaloga: Which is extremely on brand for how we've chosen to rebrand this podcast. And I, so, so viewers who might just be rejoining us after we did A Streetcar Named Desire, we did another one. I don't know how much of it will stay in…
Loading: That may - We don't know how much that of that got cut. We truly don't.
Triangle: We just – we just know that some of it needs to be cut.
Babaloga: The least ill-advised decision I think would be to cut all of it, but we might not have much podcast left if that is done. So we'll see. 
Triangle: Stay flexible! 
Babaloga: Um, yeah, we, I, I didn't read the plot summary before we started talking about it. 
Loading: No…
Babaloga: There's, I think we have one more in the can that seems okay. Like, “Not About Nightingales”? Kind of a funny title. Uh, absolutely a horrifying story. So. 
Loading: Don’t worry. We'll be releasing our YouTube apology video soon. 
Babaloga: I, I don't even own a ukulele, Loading. 
Loading: We don’t even own a ukulele and… even if we did send some texts, you know.
Babaloga: Here's a, here's a delightful one called “Will Mr. Meriweather Return from Memphis?”, which does not even have a plot summary.
Triangle: Well I - I love this one because, um, we always know that when there’s a question like this answer is “No.” So this time the answer is “Yes”! 
Loading: Yeah. 
Babaloga: Do you ever think about the fact that Memphis is in Tennessee? And the guy who wrote this, his first name is Tennessee.
Loading: Baba, you fucking idiot. Memphis is in Egypt.
Babaloga: O - oh. Okay. Sorry. I was on the wrong Memphis.
Loading: Yeah. Fucking check your white privilege.
Babaloga: Um, okay. I have one more Tennessee Williams play that is not horrifying. That is, that is non-horrifying enough that we can talk about it. And it's called “The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore.”
Loading: Right, yes!
Triangle: “The Milk Train Doesn’t-” No! I want the milk train to stop. 
Loading: Okay. Several questions. This is the- I remember this because you mentioned this one. And we were like, what the fuck is “The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore”? You vetted this one, right? 
Babaloga: Mhmm.
Loading: Okay, cool. Yeah. No, this is how the bit started. Because the milk train, guys, it doesn't stop here anymore. Several questions. What's the milk train? Tri, what's a milk train? 
Triangle: You know, I think it's a train that's just full of milk and not like the - the containers that are like giant tubes, you know? And you can fill them with liquid. It's like a normal passenger train full of milk.
Loading: So you open the door and just the milk, like, floods out.
Triangle: Yeah. And it's, just, yeah, there's just milk everywhere.
Babaloga: Ok, I was, I was picturing like one gallon jug on each seat, but um, this is better.
Triangle: No no no no! There's nothing containing the milk except for the doors and window.
Loading: It's like the elevator of blood in The Shining. But it's milk in a train car. Telling the censors, guys, don't worry, it's milk. We promise. 
Babaloga: And then you secretly fuck up the color correction so bad that it's red.  
Loading: Mm-hmm.
Babaloga: Oh no. I see the joke you were making. Never mind. 
Loading: Because in the - in the original shining, they got that past the censors by telling them it was jam. 
Babaloga: Was that true? 
Loading: That's true. Yeah. No, that's real, because that shot, I believe, was in the ad, and that was how they got people to air the ad was like, no, no, no, that's jam. 
Babaloga: Wow. 
Loading: Incredible. 
Babaloga: It's amazing they didn't get sued over that. 
Loading: It's a good shot. Yeah. So that's a milk truck. Why doesn't it come here anymore? 
Babaloga: It's a train. You said truck. 
Loading: Baba, what did I fucking say about correcting me? 
Babaloga: It's just that you're so extremely American when you say things like truck instead of train. 
Loading: Yeah, no, I know. 
[Long silence] 
Loading: Hass, keep this in. 
Babaloga: Keep that entire silence in. 
Loading: Keep that in. 
Babaloga: All right, come on. Plot summary!
Loading: All right, all right. So the train doesn't come here anymore.
Triangle: Which is a shame, because everybody wants to open the door and just have a deluge of milk.
Loading: So I think it doesn't come here anymore because there's no more tracks.
Triangle: Oh, there's no more tracks.
Loading: So the plot of the book is the train tries to come here - 
Babaloga: It's a play.
Loading: - and is derailed.
Triangle: Oh, and then, and then it's like a catastrophe because it gets derailed and there's milk everywhere.
Loading: Yeah. So here's the thing. The entire budget for the play is –
Triangle: In milk?
Loading: - the train derailment scene where a train crashes - a real train drives across the stage…
Triangle: It builds up the whole thing. And that's like the conclusion of the play. Is the train actually crashing on stage.
Loading: It crashes on stage. It destroys the stage floor. Milk is everywhere. You're covered in milk.
Triangle: The viewers get doused as if they're like on a log ride.
Loading: Yeah, yeah yeah yeah. So you're covered in milk. A train has crashed in front of you. Millions in done in property damage. This is a Broadway play so it’s New York real estate. The acoustics in the room are still immaculate.
Triangle: So, just like, after the play comes through, there's just a time when the entire street smells of milk. And that's just part of - part of the ambience.
Loading: It's the same technology as the Universal Studios tram tour. Or - what is it? What's the disaster one where they have to reset it in fourteen minutes? There's like a-a Universal Studios thing that used - I don't know if it still runs, but it would flood an entire set and then reset for in fourteen minutes.
Triangle: That's impressive.
Babaloga: I mean, yeah, that's some really impressive.
Triangle: Like, you gotta - you gotta move water to get that much. But they've, they’ve got this down even better here ‘cause it's not water that they're moving. They're moving milk.
Loading: They're moving real milk.
Triangle: Real milk. That's right.
Loading: Now what kind of milk?
Triangle: Well, I assumed it was cow milk, but it could be like, other animal’s milk? I guess it.
Loading: It could be rat milk!
Babaloga: All right, I'll say it. It could be people milk.
Loading: You didn't have to say it. 
Babaloga: Someone did. 
Loading: Did they? 
Babaloga: I don't know, but I certainly said it. So now here we are.
Triangle: You did. Yeah. It - it's there. And unless Hass cuts it out, it's there.
Babaloga: I could see Hass cutting it out. 
Loading: Let's put the human milk on the table and yell at it.
Triangle: Just yell at it?
Babaloga: I would actually rather we kept the human milk in the fridge. 
Loading: Wait, you don't like it warm and room temperature?
Babaloga: I, um. I wouldn't know.
Loading: You wouldn't know?
Triangle: You know, I would say traditionally, infants prefer it warm.
Babaloga: Yeah. You know what? That's a good point, I guess I - theoretically, I might know, but I don't remember.
Triangle: It's - it's the memory is the important part.
Loading: I mean, you can find out right now. 
Babaloga: Yeah, yeah. Okay, so the synopsis of - I will literally read the entire synopsis word for word because it's so short.
Triangle: I love that, okay.
Babaloga: “The play is set in Italy and centers on a dying, wealthy woman, Mrs. Floria Goforth-” Her name is Goforth.
Triangle: Goforth. Incredible. That's a vibe. I love that.
Babaloga: That's ridiculous. 
Loading: That's a classic Italian name!
Babaloga: - “who catches a young man, Christopher Flanders, allegedly trespassing on her estate. Dialogue between the two makes up much of the play as the character of Mrs. Goforth is in a position where, under the traditions of classic drama, she could be stoic, but she deliberately rejects the consolidations of philosophy and chooses instead to affirm eroticism and mysticism. Mrs. Goforth dies at the end of the play after making these affirmations as her definitive statement about life.”

Babaloga: It could be titty milk.
Loading: Could be titty milk. What do you think, Tri?
Babaloga: [Laughs] The man’s a father, Loading! Don't make him answer that. 
Loading: I can't wait for your kids to hear this one day.
Triangle: You think? You think they're gonna hear this one day? Optimistic.
Loading: Oh, yeah.
Babaloga: We're gonna burn every copy of this episode. 
Loading: [Laughs] Oh, I love looking at my laugh in Audacity.
Triangle: That - that actually would be a really good art of, like, making a art of different people's laughs’ waveforms. That'd be very good.
Loading: Yeah. I remember in um, for Radiolab - a podcast I know our editor fucking hates- uh, they did a farewell episode for one of their people, and one of them was like, their editor was talking to him and he's like, yeah, no, I have a file of every time you've laughed on the podcast, so I can mix them up when I'm editing and I'm like, why do you - why do you have - you don't admit that to a person. You take that shit to your grave.
Triangle: No, I think leaving the podcast is a great time to admit that.
Loading: Yeah. Uh, Baba, I've got an audio file of every time you've ever laughed. And I listen to it to go to sleep at night
Babaloga: Like, anytime I've laughed in a recorded setting or…?
Loading: No.
Babaloga: Okay. Concerning. 
Loading: Yeah.
Triangle: It's literally every laugh you've ever done in your entire life.
Loading: Every laugh you've done in your entire life, from birth to death. I've got like a time scoop from, uh, the short story “Paycheck” - the short story about a guy who leaves a factory and instead of getting paid, he signed a contract where it's like you can take a bunch of miscellaneous weird random junk, and he gets handed a bunch of miscellaneous weird random junk that is items that was sent to him from him in the past because of a machine that lets you grab items from the future.
Triangle: I'm so confused right now. Super - super bizarre.
Loading: It's a very confusing story. It's a good story.
Triangle: I love it, yeah.
Loading: Same guy who wrote – uh - Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. It’s a good story.
Babaloga: Philip K Dick. 
Loading: Yeah. That's him, the dick man. 
Babaloga: [Sounding pained] Hmm.
Triangle: Can we - can we also get a recording of that sigh? Just to - just kind of put in different places?
Loading: Yeah.
Triangle: The audio, the audio version of a reaction meme.
Loading: Yeah, Hass - can you, uh, when you're done editing, can you put that on the sound board in our discord server? 
Babaloga: You - Y'all on Mechscord won't get it. We've got our own special discord server. 
Loading: We've got healthy boundaries with Mechscord. 
Babaloga: Um, I feel like the bit is done. 
Loading: I think the bit's done. 
Babaloga: Yeah.
Loading: We've beguney with the money. 
Babaloga: Okay, that's a good - that's a good rip cord. 
Loading: We've beguney with the money, so no matter what Hass cuts and keeps, we've beguney with the money at this point.
Triangle: That's right. The good, the good stuff is there.
Loading: Hey, teens, you may know our- our book, "How Bad A Day Can Be"? Get ready for the Sequel, baby: " How,"- "How Good A Day Can Be." 
Babaloga: No, but that's not the title we agreed on. 
Loading: What's the name of the sequel? 
Babaloga: I believe it was "How Bad A Day Can Be Even Worse". 
Triangle: Wait, the- these two titles are like polar opposites, so I think I - I think I'm gonna need some explanation here? 
Babaloga: Well, Loading clearly came up with one on the spot. 
Loading: It's like, okay, so you know how the divine comedies, there's three books, there's Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory? We've done the same thing. So the first book is Purgatory.
Triangle: Ok was going to say - is the first one Purgatory or is the first one Hell? Okay. Perfect. Uh-huh.
Loading: First one is Purgatory. The sec- the "How Good A Day Can Be"? That's hell.
Triangle: Oh, oh! Plot twist, ok! 
Loading: "How Bad A Day Can Be Even Worse"? That's Heaven.
Triangle: All right. All right. I think I can follow that logic.
Loading: Find it in your local Barnes and Noble. Is it good? 
Triangle: And um, to be clear - don't check my local Barnes and Noble because, um, I was, I was not involved in writing this.
Loading: No. Well, Tri's - Tri you're working on a book, aren't you?
Triangle: Um, you know, I actually low-key am working on a children's book and, 
Loading: Huh!
Triangle: I, I think it'll be good. I think it'll be good. Will this actually ever happen? Probably not because the follow through is not gonna happen, but I really do desperately want to children's book that goes through the digestive tract and what happens when you eat food all the way through your entire body. 'cause the kids gotta know! 
Loading: Hmm.
Triangle: Kids love, kids love that kind of thing! They- they think that kind of thing is cool.
Loading: They gotta know. They ask! 
Triangle: Yeah! ‘Cause there's lots of good children's books are on the concept of the body and what's going on and the bones and everything, 
Loading: Mm-hmm. 
Triangle: - But there's not any - 
Loading: Why are you full of flesh?
Triangle: - any that like clearly walk you through every step of the way of digestion and a kid's eating all the time. So a kid's, a kid's gonna wanna know that.
Loading: Now, Tri. You actually have blog. Would you care to plug that now? 
Triangle: Yeah. I mean, I have a blog and if you want to visit it, it's Neocities - EsotericTriangle - and it's a good time.
Loading: Yeah, it's always a delight. You get to hear about what Tri’s been cooking lately, recently. You get to hear about Tri being a good dad – Tri’s an excellent father for anyone unacquainted with Tri - and you get to read all about that on this wonderful blog that he has. How often are updates?
Triangle: You know, updates are whenever I have a thought. And so you could have five updates in a single day, or you could go three or four weeks without an update. It's the ideal posting schedule.
Loading: It's really nice. Yeah. So check that out on EsotericTriangle - all one word  - dot neocities dot org [https://esoterictriangle.neocities.org/ ]. You'll know it's here because there's a little picture of a bug there.
Triangle: Yeah, it's a very important bug for the record too. It's not just any bug, it's a earwig. Because the - the bugs that everybody thinks are like, extra gross are all the bugs that are most important, doing things like turning wood into dirt and everything.
Loading: Oh, that's really cool. You're a cool guy, Tri! Anyway. Thank you all for tuning in to the money. We are doney with the money. 
Babaloga: I feel like we need, like, five to ten more minutes of banter.
Triangle: When does it - when does it feel like we have actually finished this podcast episode? We - we probably do need some kind of outro though.
Babaloga: I don - I feel like the work is never finished, and that's kind of the point. It's like a statement.
Loading: In sixteen minutes we're done.
Triangle: What's the significance of sixteen minutes?
Babaloga: I think that's exactly an hour. 
Loading: That's when I hit an hour on my audacity recording. 
Babaloga: I- I just hit forty five, so it would be fifteen minutes for me. So I get to clock out a minute early.
Triangle: Yeah, you get - you get to clock out early, uh-huh. 
Loading: Let's talk about media we've ingested recently. Tri. What media have you ingested recently?
Triangle: Let's see here what media have - Well I'm playing Donkey Kong: Bananza with my daughter and I'm reading - 
Loading: Oh, how is that?
Triangle: It's very fun. It's a great game to be playing with a kid, because you just kind of run around and smash things, and you get bananas, and Donkey Kong gets excited about the bananas and so you get to be excited about bananas. And then also there's like a little teenager girl hanging out with the giant gorilla. And that's a sure hit to a kid. Like, what's not to love about that?
Loading: Are you playing this with your older or your younger child?
Triangle: Uh, older. My - my younger daughter just doesn't really care about TV things ‘cause she's eight months.
Babaloga: I'm not - I'm not an expert on like, child development, but I think that probably your younger would be a little young to be playing a video game. 
Loading: Yeah, but she might look at the pretty colors.
Triangle: The - the only person playing here is me. Everybody else is watching. The kids enjoy watching me do it because they're - they're not coordinated.
Babaloga: When you say everybody else is watching, I'm imagining, like you and your kids and your wife and, like, four or five cats all huddled up staring at the TV while you play.
Triangle: Wait, wait, you think I have four or five cats? Do you think I could handle that many cats?
Babaloga: I don't know, just like a big - a big ol’ mass of people. Just like watching you play this game. Absolutely rapt. 
Loading: Just a writhing mass of humanity.
Bablaloga: Well, I wouldn't say writhing, but. Yeah. 
Loading: You're kind of writhing right now, aren't you? 
Babaloga: The - the - the shitty thing is that you're right. I'm not at the moment, but I sort of was at the exact instant that you said that. I don't like this. I don't like that. I don't like that that just happened. 
Loading: You're - you're - you're a big proponent of writhing in the workplace.
Triangle: Writhing in the workplace.
Babaloga: If you're not gonna writhe on time, don't writhe at all. 
Loading: Some people call it stretching, but.
Triangle: I’m - I'm gonna be thinking about the phrase writhing in the workplace for a very long time.
Loading: Writhing in the workplace…
Babaloga: Y'all seen the movie? Writhe-l? Never mind. That was bad. Cut that. 
Loading: Yeah, Hass, cut that.
Babaloga: If you all are hearing this, it's because Hass has mutinied.
Loading: If you guys hear that, Hass is fired. 
Triangle: [At the same time as Loading] Wait, are we paying Hass? 
Loading: Are we paying Hass?
Babaloga: Whoaa. 
Loading: No, no. This is a pro bono thing. 
Babaloga: That was, like, perfectly in sync on my end.
Triangle: I think if - it's I think if our listeners think Hass should be paid, they can, um, sign up for our Patreon, right?
Babaloga: Yeah. If they can find it.
Triangle: All the proceeds of Patreon go to Hass and editing, right? Yeah.
Loading: You can find us on Tumblr and donate there by boosting our messages. 
Babaloga: You said that so slowly, like it was true. 
Loading: I said that so slowly, as if it was a falsehood I was formulating in real time, is was more accurate.
Babaloga: It sounded like you were trying to remember what we had set up. That's the vibe I got from it. 
Loading: The fact of the matter is we're on Truth Social and nowhere else.
Triangle: Oh no.
Babaloga: We are exclusively on X, the everything app. Um, I have been playing Silksong. 
Loading: We're on Facebook, a meta product. 
Babaloga: Oh, it's. I was trying to move on. Oh, sorry.
Triangle: The joke was dead, yeah.
Babaloga: I've been playing Silksong, but that's like everyone's been playing Silksong. Nobody wants to hear me talk about Silksong. But the more interesting thing is that recently I played a game called the Abbey of Crime. It was for the Spectrum ZX (pronounced Zed-X).
Triangle: I don't even know what that is. And I know what, like most old video games are.
Babaloga: It was a British computer, hence the “zed”. 
Loading: Oh yeah. Spectrum. 
Babaloga: And it used cassette tapes for its games.
Triangle: Good. Yeah. Excellent. Actually, a lot of computers did that, and I think it's perfect and pristine.
Babaloga:  Yeah, it's - it's at least interesting.
Triangle: No, it's perfect and pristine, actually.
Babaloga: I'll take your word for it. Um, the interesting thing about this game is it's got, like, NPCs that operate on schedules.
Triangle: Oh, that is fun.
Babaloga: Um, it's got, like, advanced pathfinding for the time. It's got a pretty in-depth narrative because it's based on a book. And then they made a movie with Sean Connery about it. And then, like, some guys in the 90s remade this game, and they made the - the player character look a lot more like Sean Connery.
Triangle: Wait, wait. So hold on – is - is this the first game that got turned into a movie?
Babaloga: No, no, the movie was based on a book. The game was also based on a book. 
Loading: The first game that got turned into a movie was Super Mario Brothers 3, in a little film we call the Wizard, where a guy uses a Nintendo Power Glove to win a video game competition.
Triangle: And tries to look so cool doing it. And it actually kind of works. But then everybody who bought one was disappointed. Yeah, uh-huh.
Babaloga: The thing to remember about the Nintendo Power Glove is that it's so bad. 
Loading: I think that makes it good though. I think they should bring back the Nintendo Power Glove. 
Babaloga: I mean, they brought back the Virtual Boy…
Loading: So it's not out of the question.
Triangle: I'm so excited about the Virtual Boy. For the record, I really cannot overemphasize how insane it is, and I think everybody should be able to try it just because it's so bizarre.
Babaloga: Yeah, exactly. It was not a good piece of hardware.
Triangle: No, but it was good because it was so weird.
Babaloga: I do think it's genuinely cool that they're doing this, like, revival thing, just as like, a novelty. You know, they should bring back Radarscope, too. That's a video game deep cut for all of you video game historians. 
Loading: Is it - is it like 3D?
Triangle: Yes, it literally is stereoscopic 3D. You stick your head into - to the little hole and it's got two screens inside of there that you're looking at and it makes it 3D.
Loading: Not the OG, the new thing.
Triangle: Yeah, the new thing too.
Loading: Okay.
Triangle: It's like the it's just like the “Lay-bo” 3D thing.
Babaloga: “Lab-o”.
Triangle: But um, specifically for the Virtual Boy.
Babaloga: Calling it “Lay-bo” is so much worse. Why'd you call it “Lay-bo”? 
Loading: Well, it's short for “Lay-botomy.” Hass, cut that.
Triangle: Because phonetically, “A-B” like that would be a - a long “A”, phonetically speaking.
Babaloga: No, it's lab. It's lab, but it's Labo.
Triangle: I understand that the word that is building off of is lab, but I'm talking about pure American English phonics. That should be l-a-b-o.
Loading: Phonics isn't real, and neither are letters.
Triangle: Phonics is real and every children should be taught it.
Babaloga: The nature of my grievance with that pronunciation, Tri, is that when you call it a “Lay-bo”, it makes it sound like the root word is labia.
Triangle: You know? I mean, I guess you can - you can go with that if you really need to.
Loading: Baba, he's a married man. 
Babaloga: Anyway.
Triangle: I love how you just are gonna keep bringing that up. It's just like. I can't believe you said that for, like, the most mundane thing.
Loading: I can’t believe you said that! In front of his wife and children who are here, in the call, right now! 
Babaloga: I don't remember if I was in the middle of something and we got sidetracked. So I guess we'll just say I wasn't.
Triangle: Yeah, we - we got sidetracked by Virtual Boy because Virtual Boy is derailing, and that's part of the reason why it's so beautiful.
Loading: Do we know how much the Virtual Boy stand is going to run? 
Babaloga: A hundred bucks.
Triangle: That's the problem, actually. Um, the plastic one that looks exactly like a Virtual Boy is a hundred. And the cardboard version, because it actually does have some lenses inside of it too, is a whole $25, which I'm a little bit disappointed by. Not because it's $25 for cardboard, but because it's $25 for cardboard and a little lens thing. And I don't know how I can, like, make a template to share with people if it's got actual lenses involved too.
Babaloga: Yeah. Like you're not going to be able to do any sort of VR adjacent thing without the lenses. 
Loading: For $25, I think I’d think about it.
Babaloga: Yeah, $25 is not that bad.
Triangle: I'm legitimately, honestly probably going to, but I, I have very fond memories of playing the Virtual Boy. So I'm the target audience supremely.
Loading: The number I had in my head was $50 for like, an alright stand.
Triangle: Yeah. And the hundred dollar one really is very much an exact replica, except modified proportions to actually fit the Switch and Switch 2 inside of it. I also am desperately curious, because half the reason why it was flopped is because the refresh rate was incredibly nauseous and like, you cannot play a Virtual Boy for longer than fifteen minutes, but you could fix that. And I think they should fix that.
Babaloga: You know, I think they should do is they should put out exactly what they're doing for the Virtual Boy, but make it a Wii U gamepad instead. They should do a Wii U gamepad that you slide the switch into, and you can play Wii U games on it.
Triangle: That would be really good, wouldn't it?
Loading: The only console that I can think of that did full backwards compatibility is the PlayStation 3 first gen. 
Babaloga: What does full mean in this context? 
Loading: It means it was able to play PS1 and PS2 games. 
Babaloga: Well, yeah, but like that's going to be a lot harder for some companies than for others. Like PlayStation had the advantage of being late to the party and never having done cartridges. So it's like, yeah, whatever the discs. 
Loading: Yeah, but like, I feel like you should be able to go back at least a few generations, which you can't do with like current gen consoles. And it's sad. And it makes me sad because the only way to play like… Armored Core 4 is on like a PS3. And PS3's are slowly going to start dying. 
Babaloga: Well, you can emulate. I'm sure emulating a PS3 is pretty doable at this point.
Loading: It's kind of finicky, but it's doable.
Triangle: I think, I think in general, like no matter how you cut it for like video game restoration, history kinds of things, emulation is going to have to happen somewhere, you know?
Loading: Oh for sure. 
Babaloga: The only version of the original Abbey of Crime that you can play is emulated unless you have a ZX Spectrum, which do you? And a cassette tape of Abbey of Crime? I don't think so. It only released in Spanish!
Triangle: I mean, you should be able to make your own cassette tape for it, for the record, because that was that was kind of the whole point with the cassette tapes. You could write your own things for them.
Babaloga: With like a keyboard where you just like play the ones and zeros onto the cassette tape?
Triangle: It's just like recording something onto a cassette for recording audio.
Babaloga: Yeah, you could really easily copy a game, I assume by… 
Loading: That was like a real thing though. Like you joke about like broadcasting sound, but like, there were Ham radio stations at the time in England that would broadcast out games. 
Babaloga: Uh, there was a lot of that kind of stuff going on in Japan where you would have it wouldn't be like Ham radio, but you would have like TV stations and radio stations and stuff that would broadcast a game. And if you had the device that could record it into whatever medium…
Triangle: Well, that's the thing. You don't need any special device. You just need a tape recorder and you literally record it as if you're recording a song.
Babaloga: I don't know if any of the Japanese ones did tape recorder. I think they had like a specific little listener that like fed directly into the RAM of the system or something. 
Loading: This was like a big thing with Soviet cracking games, because that was like a big thing in the USSR was, uh, getting these outside games and just being able to absolutely crack them in half. And a lot of those games, the original Soviet games are like disappearing now, which is really interesting. I think a couple of years back there was like a preservation push that like ended up not really going too far, but it's… I don't know, these old games were sort of losing them. 
Babaloga: Yeah. I mean we- we lost a lot of early film history as well. I think that's just sort of the nature of emerging media is that… before there's the institutions to preserve these things, it's just not going to happen.
Loading: Yeah, I mean, that also happened with like a lot of early comics and stuff like, right.
Babaloga: Like, yeah, it's sort of considered trash art. It's like commercial and it's - it's novel. And so it's not respected.
Triangle: And nobody, nobody thinks it's gonna last. And so because they don't think it's going to last, they don't take any steps to make it last.
Loading: I think this is a good place to end the episode. 
Babaloga: That's a good note to end on.
Loading: It's a good note to end on.
Triangle: Just to refresh your memory, what is the name of this podcast?
Babaloga: Fuck if I know. 
Loading: Yeah. 
Babaloga: Welcome to the “Fuck If I Know” podcast. You're at the end of it, actually. You listened - you started listening from the wrong end. Go to the other end and listen.
Loading: Tri, you got anything to say before we sign off? Anything else you want to plug?
Triangle: Um, yeah. I have a really important thing I need everybody to know: they're not allowed to die in an avalanche.
Loading: Baba, you got anything? 
Babaloga: Um, I'm actually gonna play my get out of jail free card on the dying in an avalanche thing. If you want to die in an avalanche, I'm… Tri’s... Tri’s now going to be powerless to stop you. 
Loading: All right, you heard it here first all of our listeners die in an avalanche. Thank you. Fuck you. Goodbye. 
Babaloga: Why'd you listen to this? Why did you listen to this?
